        "# Conditionals and Levels of Abstraction\n",
        "In this lesson, we'll be exploring how conditionals can be used to control \"program flow.\" First, though, we're going to explore how Python \"works\" at a somewhat deeper level.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How Do Computers \"Run\" Programs?\n",
        "When you hit \"run\" on a Jupyter cell, a series of steps take place behind the scenes to execute the code in the cell. Let's break down the process into simpler steps, so it's easier to understand how the computer interprets Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Code in the cell: First, you write the Python code in a Jupyter Notebook cell. The code might include variables, functions, loops, or other programming constructs.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "x = 5\n",
        "y = 7\n",
        "result = x + y\n",
        "print(result)\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Running the cell: When you hit \"run\" (or press Shift + Enter), Jupyter sends the code in the cell to the Python interpreter, which is a special program that understands and processes Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Parsing and tokenizing: The Python interpreter starts by reading the code and breaking it down into smaller pieces called tokens. Tokens are the basic building blocks of the code, like keywords (e.g., print, if, while), variable names, operators, and literals (e.g., numbers or strings). This process is called tokenization.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Parsing: After tokenization, the interpreter checks the syntax of the code to make sure it follows Python's rules. If there are any syntax errors, the interpreter raises an exception, and you'll see an error message in the output. If the syntax is correct, the interpreter moves on to the next step.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Compilation: The Python interpreter then compiles the parsed code into an intermediate format called bytecode. Bytecode is a lower-level representation of your code that's easier for the computer to understand and execute.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Execution: Finally, the Python interpreter executes the bytecode. It processes each instruction in the bytecode one by one and performs the corresponding operations. For example, it might store values in memory, perform calculations, or call functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our example, the interpreter would:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Store the value 5 in the variable x.\n",
        "* Store the value 7 in the variable y.\n",
        "* Add the values of x and y, and store the result (12) in the variable result.\n",
        "* Call the print() function to display the value of result.\n",
        "* Output: Once the code has been executed, any output generated by the code (e.g., from print() statements) will be displayed in the Jupyter Notebook cell output area.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, when you hit \"run\" on a Jupyter cell, the computer goes through several steps to interpret and execute your Python code. It reads and checks the code, compiles it into bytecode, and then executes the bytecode step by step to perform the operations you've written in your code. Finally, it displays the output in the Notebook."

        "# Case Study: Making it Abstract\n",
        "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science that allows us to simplify complex systems by focusing on the essential features of a problem or a concept while ignoring the low-level details. This process of simplification is crucial for managing complexity, making it easier to understand, design, and maintain software and hardware systems. To better understand abstraction, let's explore what it means and how it works in different domains.\n",
        "\n",
        "In everyday life, we constantly use abstraction without even realizing it. When we read a map, we see a simplified representation of a geographic area, showing only the essential information needed to navigate. The map doesn't need to show every detail of the landscape; it highlights the critical elements, like roads and landmarks, at a level of abstraction that is useful for our purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, in computer science, we use different levels of abstraction to focus on what is relevant and ignore unnecessary details. Levels of abstraction can range from high-level, where many details are hidden, to low-level, where more specifics are exposed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For example, consider the process of designing a computer game. At a high level of abstraction, we might think about the game's story, characters, and objectives. As we move to a lower level of abstraction, we'll consider the game's mechanics, such as character movement, physics, and collision detection. At an even lower level, we'll work with code, algorithms, and data structures that make these mechanics possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Another example is computer hardware. At a high level of abstraction, we interact with computers using input devices like keyboards and output devices like monitors. At a lower level of abstraction, we can consider the computer's components, such as the processor, memory, and storage. At the lowest level, we have the electronic circuits and binary code that make up the foundation of the hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "Different levels of abstraction are useful for different purposes. High-level abstractions allow us to understand the big picture and reason about the overall structure and design of a system. They help us to communicate ideas, collaborate, and create shared mental models. Low-level abstractions, on the other hand, enable us to deal with the specifics and intricacies of a system, ensuring that it functions correctly and efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case study, we'll explore the importance of abstraction in programming languages, software development approaches, data representation, and real-world examples, showing how different levels of abstraction can help us build, understand, and maintain complex computer systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Abstraction in programming languages\n",
        "\n",
        "Programming languages are tools we use to instruct computers. They range from low-level languages, which are closer to hardware, to high-level languages that abstract many details away. Let's compare three popular programming languages: C, Java, and Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  C is a low-level language, giving programmers more control over hardware. For example, memory management is manual, making it more challenging but also more flexible.\n",
        "2.  Java is an object-oriented language that abstracts memory management through garbage collection, making it easier to use while still offering good performance.\n",
        "3.  Python is a high-level language, with a focus on simplicity and readability. It abstracts away many low-level details, allowing developers to write code more quickly and with fewer lines.\n",
        "\n",
        "As languages become more abstract, they often become easier to learn and use, but may sacrifice some performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Abstraction in software development approaches\n",
        "\n",
        "Different programming approaches exist to help developers manage complexity and create well-structured software. Let's explore three common ones:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Procedural programming** is an approach where tasks are broken down into procedures or functions. It's like a recipe, with step-by-step instructions. This approach is straightforward but can become difficult to manage as the size of the codebase grows.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Object-oriented programming (OOP)** groups data and functions into \"objects\" representing real-world entities, like a car or a person. This allows for better organization and reusability. For example, in a video game, each character could be an object with properties like health and actions like jumping.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Functional programming** treats computation as mathematical functions, avoiding changing states and mutable data. This makes reasoning about the code easier and helps prevent bugs. Imagine a calculator app that takes inputs, performs calculations, and returns results without changing any internal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Abstraction in data representation\n",
        "To solve problems, we need to represent data in a way that computers can understand. Abstraction helps us create simpler, more flexible data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Primitive data types**, like integers and characters, are the building blocks of data representation. However, they're limited in expressing more complex data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstract data types (ADTs)** are high-level structures that group primitive data types and define operations on them. Examples include lists, stacks, and queues. For instance, a music playlist can be represented as a list, allowing us to add, remove, or reorder songs easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Real-world examples of abstraction\n",
        "Abstraction is found in many real-world computer systems, making them easier to use and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Operating systems** (such as Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android) abstract hardware details, allowing us to interact with computers without worrying about low-level operations. For example, a file system lets us manage files and folders without dealing with disk sectors and memory addresses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Application programming interfaces (APIs)** provide a simplified interface for interacting with complex systems, like databases or web services. Think of a weather app that fetches data from a weather API without needing to know how the data is collected or stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Libraries** and **frameworks** help developers build applications faster by providing pre-built components and structures. A game engine, for instance, handles physics and graphics, allowing developers to focus on creating unique gameplay experiences.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Table: Levels of Abstraction\n",

        "| Libraries and Frameworks | - Provides pre-built, reusable components.<br>- Streamlines development and improves productivity with ready-made solutions. |\n",

        "In Python, you can use the **ternary conditional expression** or \"conditional expression\" to create concise one-liners for `if-else` statements. This allows you to write `if` and `else` statements within a single line, making your code shorter and sometimes easier to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "The syntax for the ternary conditional expression is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "`value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  The `condition` is evaluated first.\n",
        "2.  If the `condition` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `value_if_true`.\n",
        "3.  If the `condition` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `value_if_false`.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also chain multiple ternary conditional expressions together by nesting them. This is useful when you have multiple conditions to check. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "`value_if_true_1 if condition_1 else value_if_true_2 if condition_2 else value_if_false`\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the expression is evaluated as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  `condition_1` is evaluated first.\n",
        "2.  If `condition_1` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `value_if_true_1`.\n",
        "3.  If `condition_1` is `False`, then `condition_2` is evaluated.\n",
        "4.  If `condition_2` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `value_if_true_2`.\n",
        "5.  If `condition_2` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `value_if_false`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that while using ternary conditional expressions can make your code more concise, it can also make it harder to read when used excessively or with complex conditions. It's important to strike a balance between readability and conciseness when using this feature.\n",
