        "# Sample Project for Software Enginnering: Designing a Virtual Pet Game in Python (Extra Credit)\n",
        "Here are the specifications for a sample software project that you can try to develop. You can feel free to work on this by yourself or with a partner. Some general hints:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Start simple and gradually add complexity.\n",
        "-   Think about how real pets behave and how this can be translated into code.\n",
        "-   Regularly test your code as you develop.\n",
        "-   Keep your code organized and well-commented for easier debugging and understanding.\n",
        "-   Consider the user experience -- how will they interact with your pet?\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Stage 1: Basic Functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "*Objective*: Create a rudimentary virtual pet with basic interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Description*: In this stage, the goal is to create a simple virtual pet, akin to a digital Tamagotchi. It is based on the example provided in Chapter 10 (Software Engneering), but should have some slight enhancements. This pet will have basic attributes like hunger, happiness, and health. The user can perform simple actions like feeding the pet or playing with it to influence these attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Key Python Concepts*:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Use a **class** to define the pet with attributes (hunger, happiness, health).\n",
        "2.  Implement **methods** for actions (feed, play).\n",
        "3.  Store pet's current state using **attributes** (variables internal to a class).\n",
        "4.  Use **if-elif--else** statements for state changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of how the program might work:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The user starts the game and a message appears: \"Welcome! Meet your new virtual pet, Tammy!\"\n",
        "2. The user can view Tammy's current state: \"Hunger: 5/10, Happiness: 7/10, Health: 10/10.\"\n",
        "3. The user chooses to feed Tammy. The game updates: \"Tammy is eating... Hunger decreases to 3/10.\"\n",
        "4. The user decides to play with Tammy. The game responds: \"Tammy is playing happily! Happiness increases to 9/10.\""

        "## Writing a Python Dictionary to a File\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  First, decide on the file format. The most common ones are plain text, such as `.txt`, or `.json` (JavaScript Object Notation). JSON is particularly handy for dictionaries as it preserves the key-value structure.\n",
        "\n",

        "3.  Use Python's `open()` function to create a file object. If the file doesn't exist, Python will create it for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.   Use the `json.dump()` function to write the dictionary into the file.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "# Your dictionary\n",

        "1.  To read the file, again use the `open()` function, but this time in read mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Now, use the `json.load()` function to convert the contents of the file back into a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the code for that:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import json\n",

        "# Open the file in read mode\n",
        "with open('my_dict.json', 'r') as file:\n",
