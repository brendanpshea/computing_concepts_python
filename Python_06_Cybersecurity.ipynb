It plays a crucial role in cybersecurity by ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data transmitted and stored in digital systems. The primary function of cryptography is to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and tampering, which is vital for maintaining privacy, ensuring secure transactions, and preserving trust in digital systems.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Block cipher:** AES is a block cipher, which means it encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (128 bits) rather than individual characters. This allows AES to apply multiple rounds of complex transformations to the data, making it more resistant to attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN)**: AES uses a combination of substitution (replacing bytes with other bytes) and permutation (shuffling bytes) operations, which together provide strong confusion and diffusion properties. This ensures that even small changes in the plaintext or key result in significant changes in the ciphertext, making it difficult for an attacker to uncover any patterns or relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Key expansion:** AES uses a key expansion process to generate a series of round keys from the initial key. These round keys are used in each round of the encryption and decryption process. The key expansion adds an extra layer of security, as an attacker would need to recover all round keys to break the encryption.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Multiple rounds:** AES applies a series of encryption rounds (10, 12, or 14, depending on the key size) to the data, with each round consisting of several operations, such as SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey. These operations are designed to provide a high level of security while maintaining efficiency and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Brute-force resistance:** AES supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits, providing a large enough keyspace to resist brute-force attacks using current technology. This ensures that AES remains secure even as computational power continues to increase.\n",
        "\n",

        "# HTTPS and Secure Websites\n",
        "HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP, which is the protocol used for transmitting data between a web browser and a web server. HTTPS ensures that the data exchanged between a browser and a server is encrypted, preventing unauthorized access or tampering. This is particularly important when sensitive information, like passwords or credit card details, is being transmitted.\n",
        "\n",
        "The security of HTTPS is based on a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Let's break down the key concepts and steps involved:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Asymmetric encryption (public key cryptography): As we discussed earlier, asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. In the context of HTTPS, a web server has a public-private key pair. The public key is shared with users (browsers), while the private key is securely stored on the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  SSL/TLS certificates: **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** and its successor, **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**, are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over a computer network. When you connect to a website using HTTPS, the server presents an SSL/TLS certificate containing its public key and information about the website's identity. This certificate is issued and digitally signed by a trusted third-party called a Certificate Authority (CA), which helps the browser verify the server's authenticity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Key exchange: Once the browser has verified the server's certificate, it generates a unique secret key for symmetric encryption. This key is encrypted using the server's public key and sent back to the server. The server then decrypts this message using its private key to obtain the symmetric key. Both the browser and server now have a shared secret key, which is used for the remainder of the session.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Symmetric encryption: Unlike asymmetric encryption, symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. With the shared secret key established, the browser and server can securely communicate by encrypting and decrypting messages using this key. Symmetric encryption is computationally faster than asymmetric encryption, making it suitable for encrypting large amounts of data exchanged during an HTTPS session.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  Secure communication: With the symmetric key in place, all data transmitted between the browser and server is encrypted. This ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data, as third parties cannot read or tamper with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, HTTPS and web security rely on a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Asymmetric encryption is used to establish a secure connection, verify server authenticity, and exchange a symmetric key between the browser and server.\n",
        "-   Symmetric encryption is used to encrypt and decrypt data exchanged between the browser and server, ensuring secure communication during the HTTPS session."

        "# What is a Virus?\n",
        "A computer virus is a type of malicious software (malware) that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. Viruses can cause a wide range of issues, such as data corruption, system crashes, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. In this section, we will explore the concept of computer viruses, their functioning, and practical examples to help you better understand and identify them.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Virus Structure and Lifecycle\n",
        "**Infection mechanism:** A virus typically attaches itself to a host program or file. When the host program is executed, the virus is also executed, allowing it to infect other programs or files.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Payload:** The payload is the part of the virus that performs the malicious actions, such as corrupting files, stealing data, or causing system crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Replication:** Once a virus is executed, it attempts to replicate itself and infect other files or programs on the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Activation:** The virus payload is often triggered by a specific condition, such as a specific date, user action, or system event.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Pseudocode Example\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "function infect_files():\n",
        "    for file in list_files():\n",

        "## Types of Viruses\n",
        "\n",
        "**Boot sector viruses:** These viruses infect the boot sector of a computer's hard drive or removable media. They are executed when the system boots up, allowing them to take control before the operating system loads.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: The Stoned virus is a classic boot sector virus that was widespread in the 1980s and 1990s. It infected the boot sector of floppy disks and displayed a message, \"Your PC is now Stoned!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**File infector viruses** These viruses attach themselves to executable files (.exe or .com) and are executed when the host file is run.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: The Cascade virus was a file infector virus that caused characters on the screen to \"fall\" like a waterfall when the infected file was executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Macro viruses:** Macro viruses target applications like Microsoft Word and Excel, using the application's macro scripting language to embed malicious code in documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: The Melissa virus was a macro virus that spread through email attachments. When the infected Word document was opened, the virus sent itself to the first 50 contacts in the user's address book.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Virus Prevention and Mitigation\n",
        "**Antivirus software:** Use reputable antivirus software to scan your system for viruses and remove any detected threats.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Firewall:** Use a firewall to protect your devices from unauthorized access and to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic. Firewalls help to prevent intrusion attempts and block malicious connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Secure Wi-Fi:** Configure your home Wi-Fi with a strong password and enable WPA3 encryption to protect your network from unauthorized access. Public Wi-Fi networks can be insecure, so avoid using them for sensitive tasks or use a VPN to secure your connection.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Social Engineering Awareness\n",
        "**Phishing:** Be cautious of unsolicited emails and messages that ask for personal information or direct you to unfamiliar websites. Phishing attacks aim to deceive you into providing sensitive information or credentials, which can be used for identity theft or financial fraud.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scams:** Be aware of common online scams, such as fake tech support calls or fraudulent job offers. Scammers exploit your trust to obtain personal information or money.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Protection\n",
        "**Backup:** Regularly backup your important data to an external hard drive or a cloud storage service. Backups help you recover your data in case of device failure, accidental deletion, or a ransomware attack.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encryption:** Use encryption tools to protect sensitive data on your devices. Encryption renders your data unreadable without the correct decryption key, ensuring that unauthorized individuals cannot access it.\n",
        "\n",
