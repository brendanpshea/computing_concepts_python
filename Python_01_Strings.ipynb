The creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, named it after a British comedy show called \"Monty Python's Flying Circus.\" He enjoyed watching the show and wanted to give the language a fun and unique name. It has nothing to do with the snake!\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Easy to learn: Python is designed to be easy to understand, even for people who are new to programming. It uses plain English words and has a clean structure, so it's easier for you to learn and write code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Versatile: Python can be used for various tasks, like building websites, analyzing data, creating games, and automating tasks. This means that once you learn Python, you can use it for many different projects!\n",

        "This notebook is provided through Google Colab, short for \"Google Collaboratory.\" This is a free online service provided by Google that allows you to write, run, and share Python code using your web browser. It's like a mix between a document and a code editor. The best part is, you don't need to install any software on your computer, and you can access your work from anywhere with an internet connection.\n",

        "To start using Google Colab, follow these simple steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Open your web browser and go to the Google Colab website: https://colab.research.google.com/\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Sign in with your Google account. If you don't have one, you'll need to create one first.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "4. In the new notebook, you'll see a cell with a \"play\" button on the left. This is where you can write your Python code. Click inside the cell and type your code, like this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
        "```\n",

        "\n",
        "6. You can create more cells by clicking the \"+ Code\" button in the top-left corner. This way, you can write and run different parts of your code separately.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. To save your work, click \"File\" in the top-left corner, then select \"Save a copy in Drive.\" This will save your notebook to your Google Drive, so you can access it later.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. You can also share your notebook with others by clicking the \"Share\" button in the top-right corner. This is great for working on projects with friends or getting help from your teacher. **NOTE: You MUST make it available to the public, and not leave it \"restricted\" (since I can't open these from my rctc account)**\n",
        "\n",
        "### How I can \"Run\" the code in this notebook? How can I save my work?\n",
        "This document you're currently reading is actually a Google Colab notebook. To start writing and running your own Python code, you'll need to make a copy and connect to a runtime. Let me explain how you can do this:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Make a copy of this notebook:** Since you can't edit this shared notebook directly, you'll need to create a copy of it in your own Google Drive. To do that, click \"File\" in the top-left corner, and then select \"Save a copy in Drive.\" A new notebook will open, and you'll be able to edit, run, and save your code in that copy.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Connect to a runtime:** After making a copy of the notebook, you'll need to connect to a runtime. A runtime is like a computer in the cloud that runs your code. To connect, click the \"Connect\" button in the top-right corner of your screen. Once connected, you'll see a green checkmark and the word \"Connected\" instead of the \"Connect\" button.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Download your work as an IPYNB file:** Once you've finished working on your notebook and want to download it to your computer, you can save it as an IPYNB file (short for \"IPython Notebook\"). To do this, click \"File\" in the top-left corner, then select \"Download\" and choose \"Download .ipynb.\" This will download your notebook to your computer, and you can open it later using other tools like Jupyter Notebook or share it with others."

        "```\n",
        "print \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "This will give you a syntax error because the print function needs parentheses around its arguments. To fix this error, add parentheses around the text you want to print.\n",
        "4. Misspelling the print function:\n",
        "```\n",
        "prit(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "This will give you a \"NameError\" because Python doesn't recognize the misspelled function name. Double-check your spelling and make sure you use the correct function name.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Function:\n",
        "A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions help us organize our code, make it easier to read, and avoid repeating the same code over and over. Functions in Python have a name, like print, and can be called using that name followed by parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you call a function, it executes the code inside it and may return a result. For example, the print function displays a message on the screen. Functions can also take input, called \"parameters\" or \"arguments,\" which we'll discuss next.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Parameters (or Arguments):\n",
        "Parameters are the inputs a function can accept to perform its task. When we call a function, we pass these inputs inside the parentheses. These inputs can be values like numbers, text (strings), or even other variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of the print function, it takes one or more parameters, which are the values you want to display. The print function then uses these parameters to determine what to display on the screen. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the parameter is the text \"Hello, World!\". The print function takes this parameter and displays it on the screen.\n",

        "1. The function print is a block of reusable code that can accept one or more inputs (parameters) to display a message on the screen. \n",

        " A variable is a fundamental concept in programming that helps us store and manage information. Let me explain what a variable is and how it works in simple terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is a variable?\n",
        "A variable is like a container or a box that stores a value in your program. You can think of it as a label or a name you give to a piece of data, so you can easily refer to it later. Variables help us keep track of information, perform calculations, and make decisions in our code.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, you can create a variable by giving it a name and assigning a value to it using the equal sign (=). Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "age = 21\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we created a variable named age and stored the number 21 in it. Now, whenever we refer to age in our code, Python will know that it represents the number 21.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Working with variables:\n",
        "Once you have a variable, you can use it in different ways, like performing calculations or passing it to functions. Here's an example that demonstrates how to use variables with the print function:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "name = \"Gandalf\"\n",
        "age = 345\n",
        "print(\"Hello, my name is\", name, \"and I am\", age, \"years old.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we created two variables: name and age. We then used the print function to display a message that includes the values stored in these variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variables can also be updated or changed throughout your program. For example, if Gandalf a birthday, you could update the age variable like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "age = age + 1\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, the age variable contains the value 346 , and if we use the print function again, it will show the updated age:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "print(\"Hello, my name is\", name, \"and I am\", age, \"years old.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This will now display: \"Hello, my name is Gandalf and I am 346 years old.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "So:\n",
        "1. A variable is like a container that stores a value in your program. \n",

        "# Case Study: The Long Tail (Tale) of Python\n",
        "Once upon a time, in a world of formal languages and mathematical notation, slithered a programming language named Python. Its history is intertwined with the age-old quest to make sense of the universe and the development of systems to represent and manipulate knowledge. To understand the tale of Python, we must first take a trip through the annals of history, from the era of Aristotle and Euclid to the creation of this serpentine programming language, all while appreciating the occasional snake joke.\n",
        "\n",
        "## A Formal Language vs. A Natural Language\n",
        "\n",
        "For students new to computer science, understanding the difference between a formal language and a natural language is crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Formal languages** are artificially constructed languages used in fields such as mathematics, logic, and computer programming. They include programming languages like Python and logical systems like predicate logic. Formal languages are designed to be precise, unambiguous, and easy for machines to understand. They consist of symbols, rules (also known as grammar), and syntax that allow humans to represent and manipulate abstract concepts and communicate with machines. In a formal language, every expression has a clear, single meaning, and there is no room for ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, consider a simple formal language with only two symbols, 0 and 1, and a single rule: \"every string must start with 0.\" In this language, \"01\" is a valid string, but \"10\" is not. If you attempt to use an invalid string, you'll encounter a syntax error, which is a violation of the language's rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Natural languages**, on the other hand, are the languages we speak and write, such as English, Spanish, or Mandarin. These languages are rich in nuance and subtlety, but they are also inherently ambiguous. Ambiguity arises when words, phrases, or sentences can have multiple interpretations. For example, the word \"bank\" can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river. This ambiguity makes natural languages challenging for computers to interpret.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of an intro to computer science class, it's essential to understand that programming languages like Python are formal languages specifically designed to bridge the gap between the complexity of human thought and the precision required for machine understanding. When writing code, you must follow the strict rules of syntax and grammar to avoid syntax errors and ensure the program behaves as intended. This contrasts with natural languages, where we can often convey our thoughts even when our grammar or wording is imprecise.\n",
        "\n",
        "##The Beginning: Aristotle and Euclid\n",
        "\n",
        "Our story begins with Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher who laid the groundwork for formal logic in the 4th century BCE. Aristotle sought to create a system to evaluate the validity of arguments and capture the essence of reasoning. His syllogisms were the precursors of formal languages, and their influence can be seen even in the venomous bite of Python's syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "Aristotle's syllogisms were based on a structure consisting of a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Major premise: All snakes are reptiles.\n",
        "2.  Minor premise: A python is a snake.\n",
        "3.  Conclusion: A python is a reptile.\n",
        "\n",
        "Euclid, another ancient Greek mathematician, laid the foundation for geometry around the same time. He developed a rigorous axiomatic system, where a small number of statements, known as axioms, were combined to derive more complex theorems. This systematic approach to organizing and proving mathematical truths is a major part of the backbone of computer science and is woven into Python's DNA.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, one of Euclid's axioms states that \"a straight line can be drawn between any two points.\" Using this axiom, along with others, Euclid derived theorems such as the Pythagorean theorem and the properties of triangles.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Middle Ages: The Birth of Algebra\n",
        "\n",
        "Fast forward to the Middle Ages, when algebra was born out of the efforts of Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi. Algebra introduced the concept of using symbols to represent unknown values, providing the foundation for the manipulation of abstract entities that would eventually become commonplace in programming languages like Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider the following algebraic equation:\n",
        "\n",
        "x + 3 = 5\n",
        "\n",
        "In this equation, x represents the unknown value (the length of a snake, perhaps). Solving for x, we find that x = 2 (the snake is 2 units long).\n",
        "\n",
        "So, next time you use a variable in Python, remember that you're harkening back to the hiss-torical origins of algebra:\n",
        "\n",
        "`snake_length = 2`\n",
        "\n",
        "## Boolean Algebra and Turing Machines\n",
        "\n",
        "As we slither into the 19th century, we encounter George Boole, an English mathematician who devised the system of **Boolean algebra**. This formal language of true and false values, along with the operations AND, OR, and NOT, is now a cornerstone of digital circuit design and computer programming, including Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider a snake-themed Boolean expression in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "is_reptile = True\n",
        "has_legs = False\n",
        "\n",
        "is_snake = is_reptile and not has_legs\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In the 20th century, the concept of a theoretical computing machine emerged from the mind of Alan Turing. The **Turing Machine**, an abstract device with an infinite memory tape, could read, write, and manipulate symbols based on a set of rules. Turing's work paved the way for the development of computers and the creation of programming languages like Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Turing Machine can be thought of as a simple model of a Python interpreter. It reads Python code, processes it according to the language's syntax and semantics, and produces the corresponding output. This theoretical foundation helped establish the field of computer science and continues to inform the design of modern programming languages like Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Modern Era\n",
        "### Early Computers and Assembly Language\n",
        "\n",
        "In the 1940s and 1950s, the first electronic computers were developed, such as the ENIAC, the Manchester Mark 1, and the IBM 701. These early computers were programmed using low-level assembly languages, which were specific to each machine's hardware. Assembly languages were difficult to work with and required a deep understanding of the computer's architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Advent of High-Level Programming Languages\n",
        "\n",
        "To make programming more accessible and efficient, researchers developed high-level programming languages in the 1950s and 1960s. These languages, such as Fortran (for scientific computations) and COBOL (for business applications), used more human-readable syntax and abstracted away hardware details. This made it easier for programmers to write and maintain code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Structured Programming and the C Language\n",
        "\n",
        "In the 1960s and 1970s, the concept of structured programming emerged, promoting the use of well-organized code with clear control structures. The C language, developed in the early 1970s, was one of the first languages to adopt structured programming principles. C's simplicity, power, and portability made it extremely popular and influenced many future languages, including Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Object-Oriented Programming and the Birth of Python\n",
        "\n",
        "During the 1980s and 1990s, object-oriented programming (OOP) gained popularity. OOP languages, such as Smalltalk and Java, allowed developers to model real-world objects and their interactions, making it easier to design and maintain complex software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 1989, Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum began working on a new language that combined the best features of existing languages, with an emphasis on simplicity and readability. This language, named Python after the British comedy group Monty Python, quickly gained popularity for its clean syntax, powerful libraries, and versatility.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Python: A Serpentine Success\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's success can be attributed to its simplicity, readability, and flexibility. Its syntax is inspired by the long tail of formal languages that preceded it, yet it remains accessible to newcomers and experts alike. Python's versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis and artificial intelligence.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the long tail (tale) of Python is a fascinating journey through the development of formal languages, starting from the ancient Greeks' pursuit of logic and mathematical rigor to the modern age of computing. This serpentine programming language has coiled itself around the world of computer science, leaving its mark on the field and providing a powerful tool for solving complex problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you embark on your adventure in computer science, remember to appreciate the rich history behind the formal languages you'll encounter. And if you ever find yourself in a coding conundrum, just take a deep breath, channel your inner Python, and keep calm and \"constrict\" your focus on the task at hand. After all, even the most venomous of problems can be tamed with the right combination of logic, syntax, and a healthy dose of Pythonic charm.\n",
