        "## What is Computer Programming?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Computer programming** is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining instructions that tell a computer what to do. These instructions, known as code, are written in specialized languages called programming languages. Just like how we communicate with each other using languages like English or Spanish, we communicate with computers using programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you write code, you're essentially creating a set of instructions that the computer follows to perform specific tasks, such as displaying text on the screen, performing calculations, or even creating interactive games. It's like giving the computer a recipe to follow, step by step.\n",
        "\n",
        "Programming languages are considered **formal languages**, which means they have strict rules and syntax that must be followed for the code to work correctly. In contrast, **natural languages**, like the ones we speak, have more flexibility and ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it this way: when you talk to a friend, they can usually understand what you mean even if you use slang, make grammatical errors, or pause in the middle of a sentence. However, computers are more literal and require precise instructions. If you make a mistake in your code, like forgetting a comma or misspelling a word, the computer won't be able to understand what you want it to do, and you'll encounter an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this classs, we'll be focusing mostly on Python. **Python** is a popular, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was named after the famous British comedy troupe, Monty Python, because the language's creator, Guido van Rossum, was a fan of their work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is widely used for various applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. One of the reasons for its popularity is that it has a clean and straightforward syntax, making it easier to learn and write compared to some other programming languages.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "As you begin your journey into the world of programming, you'll likely hear about the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its impact on the field. In recent years, AI has made significant strides, particularly with the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Mistral. These tools can assist programmers by generating code snippets, answering questions, and providing guidance on various coding problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How LLMs Can Help Programmers.** LLMs are trained on vast amounts of code and can understand and generate code in multiple programming languages. They can help you in several ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   LLMs can suggest **code completions** as you type, saving you time and effort.\n",
        "2.   You can describe a task in natural language, and the LLM will **generate code** to accomplish that task.\n",
        "3.   LLMs can provide **explanations** and guidance on coding concepts, helping you learn and understand better.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let's say you're working on a Python script to analyze data from a survey. You're stuck on how to calculate the average age of the survey respondents. You could ask an LLM like Claude:\n",
        "\n",
        "> How do I calculate the average age from a list of ages in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "And Claude might respond with:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "ages =  [25,  30,  45,  28,  32,  37,  29,  41]\n",
        "average_age =  sum(ages)  /  len(ages)  \n",
        "print(f\"The average age is: {average_age}\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This can give you a quick solution and help you move forward with your project.\n",
        "\n",
        "While LLMs can be incredibly helpful, it's crucial to remember that they are tools to assist you, not replace your understanding of programming. To use these tools effectively and create successful programs, you need to grasp the fundamental concepts of programming and understand why and how code works the way it does.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, Imagine you ask an LLM to write a function that prints out quotes from Monty Python sketches (as we will do below). The LLM might generate something like this:\n",
