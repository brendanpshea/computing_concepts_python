        "| Term | Definition |\n",
        "|------|------------|\n",
        "| Binary | The number system using only two digits (0 and 1) that matches a computer's ability to detect whether electricity is flowing or not; the foundation for all computer data representation. |\n",
        "| Bit | The smallest unit of information in computing, representing either 0 or 1, forming the foundation of all digital information. |\n",
        "| Byte | A group of 8 bits that can represent 256 different values, serving as a fundamental unit of digital storage. |\n",
        "| Boolean | A data type with only two possible values (True or False), used for logical operations and decision making in programs. |\n",
        "| Character Encoding | Systems that assign unique binary codes to text characters, allowing computers to store and process text; examples include ASCII and Unicode. |\n",
        "| Compiler | A program that translates entire source code into machine code before execution, creating standalone executable files. |\n",
        "| Comment | Text in code (preceded by #) that's ignored by the computer but provides explanations for humans reading the code. |\n",
        "| Data Type | A classification that specifies what kind of data a variable can hold, determining what operations can be performed on it. |\n",
        "| Dynamic Typing | A feature in Python where the language automatically determines a variable's type based on the assigned value. |\n",
        "| Floating-Point | Numbers with decimal components (like 3.14) that computers store using a sign bit, exponent, and mantissa according to standards like IEEE 754. |\n",
        "| Function | A named block of reusable code that performs a specific task, optionally accepting inputs (parameters) and returning outputs. |\n",
        "| Hexadecimal | A base-16 number system using digits 0-9 and letters A-F, commonly used as a more readable representation of binary values. |\n",
        "| IEEE 754 | The standard format for representing floating-point numbers in computers, using a sign bit, exponent, and mantissa. |\n",
        "| Integer | Whole numbers without fractional parts, stored in binary form in computer memory. |\n",
        "| Interpreter | A program that translates code line-by-line during execution, without creating a separate executable file. |\n",
        "| Parameter | A variable listed in a function definition that acts as a placeholder for values provided when the function is called. |\n",
        "| Print Function | Python's standard way to display information in the console, taking one or more items to display. |\n",
        "| Program Flow | The order in which statements in a program are executed, determined by the structure of the code. |\n",
        "| Programming Language | A formal language with syntax and semantics used to give instructions to a computer. |\n",
        "| Scientific Notation | A way of writing numbers that are too large or too small in a more concise form, similar to how floating-point numbers are stored. |\n",
        "| Source Code | The human-readable text of a computer program written in a programming language. |\n",
        "| String | A sequence of characters (text) enclosed in quotes, one of the fundamental data types in programming. |\n",
        "| Two's Complement | The system computers use to represent negative numbers in binary, making arithmetic operations work correctly. |\n",
        "| Unicode | A universal character encoding standard that can represent over 140,000 characters from all world languages. |\n",
        "| Variable | A named storage location that holds data, allowing programmers to store and manipulate information throughout a program. |"
