        "### Brendan Shea, PhD (Brendan.Shea@rctc.edu)\n",
        "In the simplest terms, a **network** is a collection of devices that are interconnected and can communicate with each other. These devices can range from computers, laptops, and smartphones to printers, servers, or even IoT devices like smart fridges or thermostats. The purpose of this connection is to share and exchange information and resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "A network allows for the sharing of data and resources, such as files, applications, or even hardware like printers, in a much more efficient and collaborative manner than would be possible without the network. For example, instead of storing a file on a USB drive and physically carrying it to another computer, a network allows you to send the file directly, saving time and effort.  \n",
        "\n",
        "There are two primary types of networks: Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs).\n",
        "\n",
        "- A **Local Area Network (LAN)** is a network that connects devices in a relatively small area, such as a home, office, or a group of buildings. These networks are typically owned, controlled, and managed by a single person or organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- On the other hand, a **Wide Area Network (WAN)** covers a large geographical area and connects multiple LANs together. The **internet** is the most prominent example of a WAN, which is a global network of networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Networks can also be classified based on their design approach: **Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks**, where each device has equivalent responsibilities and capabilities, or **client-server networks**, where some computers (servers) provide services, and others (clients) use those services.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, Networks operate based on established rules and **protocols**, which define how the devices should transmit and receive data. These protocols ensure that networks across the globe can communicate with each other seamlessly, leading to the interconnected world we live in today. In this lesson, you'll learn some of the most important of these protocols, including the the Internet Protocol (IP), Tranmission Control Protocol (TCP), and Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP)."

        "## How Network \"Models\" Aid Understanding\n",
        "Imagine you're trying to bake a cake without a recipe. You know you need ingredients like flour, sugar, eggs, and so on, but you don't know how much of each ingredient to use, or in what order to mix them. The result would be a disaster. A recipe guides you, telling you exactly what to do step-by-step.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a similar way, a **network model** is like a recipe for computer networks. But instead of baking a cake, we're trying to transmit data, like emails or web pages, from one device to another over the network.  Now, why do we need a network model or this \"recipe\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Understanding Networks: Networks can be complex with many different parts working together. It's like trying to understand a busy city with all its people, cars, buses, buildings, and roads. If we tried to understand everything at once, we'd get confused. But if we break it down into parts - like people, transportation, infrastructure - it's easier to understand. Network models do the same for networks. They break down the whole process of data transfer into layers. Each layer has a specific job, making it easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Building Networks: When we're building networks, we want to ensure that all the parts can \"talk\" to each other - that is, they can send and receive data correctly. Network models provide a common language or standard that all parts of the network can understand and follow. This ensures that different devices, perhaps made by different companies, can still communicate with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Fixing Problems: Let's go back to the city example. If there's a traffic jam, we don't need to look at every person, car, or building in the city to find the problem. We just focus on the transportation - the roads and cars. Similarly, in networks, when something goes wrong, we can look at each layer separately to find and fix the problem. This makes troubleshooting much easier and faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "In simple terms, a network model helps us to understand how a network works, how to build a network so all parts can work together, and how to fix problems when they arise. Without it, creating and maintaining networks would be a lot more complicated."

        "## A Four-Layer Network Model: TCP-IP\n",
        "Think of the process of sending a letter through the postal service. You write your letter (the message), put it in an envelope (packaging), write the address (where it needs to go), and then give it to the postal service (the transportation system). The postal service then delivers the letter to the address you wrote on the envelope. The person who receives the letter opens the envelope and reads your message.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, when a device wants to send data to another device over a network, it has to go through a process. To make this process easier to understand, we break it down into steps, or layers. Each layer has a specific job to do, just like in our postal service example.  In the four-layer (**TCP-IP**) network model, these layers are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Application Layer:** This is where our \"letter\" starts. The application layer is where network applications (like your web browser or email client) live. It's what you, as the user, interact with. When an application wants to send data, it's the application layer's job to package that data so it can be sent over the network. This might include formatting a web page into HTML, turning an email into text, or converting a voice call into digital audio. It also works the other way around, converting incoming data into something the user can understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Transport Layer:** Once our \"letter\" is packaged, it needs to be delivered. That's the job of the transport layer. This layer establishes a connection between the sending and receiving devices and ensures that data is reliably sent. It does this by breaking down the data from the application layer into smaller **packets** and tracking them to ensure they all reach the destination. It's kind of like taking a large letter and breaking it down into postcards, each with a number so you can put them back together in the right order.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Internet Layer:** Now that our \"letter\" is packaged and ready for transport, we need to figure out where it's going.  The Internet layer is responsible for routing the data packets to the right destination. It adds the IP addresses of the sender and receiver to the data packets so that they can be correctly routed. In other words, it figures out the best way to get the data from the sender to the receiver, kind of like how a GPS finds the best route to your destination.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Network Interface (\"Data Link\") Layer:**  This is the final step. The Network Interface Layer is in charge of the physical transmission of data. It's like our mail carrier in the letter example. This layer takes the data packets, converts them into a form that can be transmitted physically (like electrical signals or radio waves), and sends them onto the network. It also receives incoming data and converts it back into a form the upper layers can understand. (So, incoming data needs to go through these same four steps, except \"backwards\").\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, the four-layer network model is a way of breaking down the process of sending data over a network into manageable steps, making it easier to understand and manage. It helps us understand how data gets from one application to another over a network."

        "The Application Layer, the topmost layer of the four-layer network model, encompasses protocols that users often interact with directly, albeit behind the scenes of user-friendly applications. These protocols enable activities like web browsing, email communication, and file transfers. Critical to the functioning of these protocols is the concept of \"ports.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of networking, a **port** is a virtual point where network connections start and end. Ports are associated with specific processes or services in a system, and each service has a unique port number. Port numbers help the system identify the correct application or service for which the data is intended. Essentially, they are like apartment numbers in a large building, ensuring the mail (or data) gets to the correct resident (or application).\n",
        "\n",
        "Some port numbers are reserved for specific services as per the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). These are known as well-known port numbers, ranging from 0 to 1023. Let's discuss some well-known application layer protocols and their associated port numbers:\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** The protocol used for transferring web content. HTTP uses port 80. When you type a URL into your browser and hit Enter, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server via this port.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **HTTPS (HTTP Secure):** A secure version of HTTP, HTTPS uses port 443. It's used when a secure connection is required, for example, when entering sensitive information like credit card details on a website.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** FTP is used for transferring files between hosts. It uses two ports - port 20 for data transfer and port 21 for command control. It's commonly used for uploading files to a web server or downloading files from a server to a user's computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** SMTP is used for sending emails, operating on port 25. When you hit send on an email, your email client uses SMTP to route the message to the recipient's email server.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)** and **POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3)**: These protocols are used for receiving emails. IMAP uses port 143, while POP3 uses port 110. When you open your email client to check your inbox, it's using either IMAP or POP3 to fetch the messages from the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **DNS (Domain Name System):** DNS uses port 53. It's the protocol that translates human-friendly URLs into the IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "Knowing about ports and their importance helps us understand the intricacy of network communication. While we enjoy browsing websites or sending emails, these processes rely heavily on the proper functioning and coordination of numerous network protocols and services, which in turn depend on ports."

        "\n",
        "The **Hyptertext Transport Protocol (HTTP)** in an application-layer protocolinvented by Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, and his team at CERN in 1989. The purpose of HTTP is to allow the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents, images, and videos, from servers and displaying them on a client's browser. Essentially, HTTP is the protocol that enables communication between web browsers (clients) and web servers, allowing us to surf the internet.\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTP is critically important because it forms the foundation of any data exchange on the web. It's not an exaggeration to say that almost every action you perform on the internet---from clicking a link, to typing a URL into your browser's address bar, to submitting a form on a webpage---starts an HTTP request.\n",
        "HTTP is based on the request-response model. That means the communication usually begins with a client (for instance, your browser) making a request to a server. The server, upon receiving this request, processes it and sends a response back to the client.  Here's a simplified step-by-step breakdown of how this works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Client Sends a Request: Let's say you want to visit `www.example.com`. When you type this URL into your browser and hit Enter, your browser starts an HTTP request. This request is a message which includes information like the desired action (often \"GET\" to fetch data, though there are other methods), the URL, and the HTTP version.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Server Processes the Request: The HTTP request message is received by the web server hosting `www.example.com`. The server processes the request, interpreting what resources are asked for and what action the client wants to perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Server Sends a Response: After processing, the server forms an HTTP response and sends it back to the client. This response includes a status code that indicates whether the request was successful (for example, \"200\" for success) or if there were any errors (for example, \"404\" means the requested page was not found). Along with the status code, if the request was successful, the server includes the requested resource in the response---for instance, the HTML of a web page.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Client Displays the Response: Once your browser receives the HTTP response, it interprets the data and renders the web page on your screen. If the requested resource is an HTML file, the browser reads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, fetches any necessary additional files (like images), and displays the formatted page for you to view.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, this is a simplified explanation. In reality, there's a lot more complexity involved, including things like HTTP headers for transmitting metadata, cookies for maintaining state, and HTTPS for securing communications. But at its heart, HTTP is about sending a request from a client to a server, and returning a response from the server back to the client. This basic model underlies much of the activity on the internet."

        "## Two Ways to Transport Data (TCP and UDP)\n",
        "The **Transport Layer** plays a vital role in network communication. It's responsible for end-to-end communication services for applications. It ensures complete data transfer and provides reliable, transparent transfer of data between end systems, or hosts. It achieves this using protocols, the most common of which are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** TCP provides a reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of packets. TCP is like sending a registered mail through a post office -- you have a guarantee that it will arrive, and in the same order you sent it.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Key features of TCP include:\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Reliable Transmission: TCP has mechanisms for ensuring all data sent is received correctly at the other end. If packets are lost or corrupted during transmission, TCP will retransmit them. This ensures that no data is lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Flow Control: TCP manages the rate of data transmission between two network devices to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slower receiver, which could otherwise lead to lost packets.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Ordered Delivery: If packets arrive at the destination out of order (which can happen as packets can take different paths through the network), TCP will reorder them.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Congestion Control: TCP can control traffic from source to destination, helping to keep the network efficient and preventing traffic bottlenecks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** On the other hand, UDP is a simpler, connectionless Internet protocol. With UDP, packets are sent without establishing a connection and without any delivery guarantee. It's like throwing a letter into the mailbox and hoping it arrives---it might get lost or arrive out of order.\n",
        "\n",
        "    UDP doesn't provide the reliability mechanisms of TCP---it doesn't guarantee delivery, preserve sequences, or protect against data corruption during transmission. However, this makes UDP faster and more efficient for many lightweight or time-sensitive applications. Examples include live broadcasts and online multiplayer games.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both TCP and UDP use port numbers to pass data to the upper layers. Port numbers are used to distinguish different types of data and different applications or services. They work like addresses, ensuring that the data is delivered to the correct software application on a network device.\n",
        "\n",
        "The role of the Transport Layer, in essence, is to provide the Application Layer with session and datagram communication services. These services are provided by using either TCP or UDP, depending on the specific requirements of the application."

        "## How the Internet Protocol (IP) Enables Global Connectivity\n",
        "The Internet Layer, also known as the network layer, is responsible for receiving segments from the Transport Layer and packaging them into packets. But perhaps its most significant role is addressing, routing, and forwarding these packets to allow communication between networks, hence facilitating global connectivity. Let's dive into this.\n",
        "\n",
        "- IP Addressing: At the heart of this process is the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines the system of IP addresses. An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses IP for communication. There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. **IPv4 addresses** are composed of four sets of numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1). **IPv6 addresses**, which are being more widely used due to the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, are composed of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).  Each IP address in an IP network must be unique within that network.\n",
        "\n",
        "- IP Routing: The Internet Layer is also responsible for routing data packets to their destinations using IP addresses. Each **router** connected to the network has a table known as the **routing table** that stores routes (paths) to different network destinations. It uses these tables to decide the best path for forwarding the packets.  When a data packet is sent from one network to another, it usually passes through several routers. Each router examines the IP address of the packet's destination and consults its routing table to decide which way to send the packet. The packet is forwarded from router to router along the path until it reaches its destination network.\n",
        "\n",
        "- IP Forwarding: The process of sending the packets from one network to another, as decided by the routers, is known as **forwarding**. The routers at the boundary of each network are responsible for forwarding the packets to the next network on the path to the destination.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Private and Public IP Addresses: Each device connected to a network receives an IP address, which can be either public or private. A **public IP address** is a globally unique address that is assigned to a device, like a router, that connects directly to the internet. These addresses are used across the entire internet to locate networked devices. **Private IP addresses**, on the other hand, are used within private networks such as home, office, or enterprise networks. These addresses are not routable on the open internet and therefore provide a layer of security by inherently hiding the networked device from the world. Common private IPv4 address ranges include 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The combination of unique IP addressing and the capability of IP routing and forwarding enables global connectivity. Regardless of the network, each device can send packets to any other device in the world, as long as they are both connected to the internet. The packets are routed through various networks and routers on their journey, each hop getting them closer to their destination, until they ultimately reach the correct device."

        "1.  Late 1950s - Early 1960s: The precursor to the internet was the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), funded by the U.S. Department of Defense during the Cold War. It was a response to the Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957, which pushed the U.S. to invest more heavily in technological research and development. The initial aim of ARPANET was to create a network that could survive a nuclear attack, by decentralizing information and enabling communication even if part of the network was destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  1969: The first message was sent over ARPANET by a student programmer at UCLA to a computer at Stanford. The system crashed after only the first two letters of the intended message \"LOGIN\" were transmitted, but it was still a significant moment in the history of the internet.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  1970s: Throughout the '70s, the technology and protocols that would form the backbone of the internet were developed. In 1974, the term \"Internet\" was first used, and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), which allows for effective data transmission between multiple networks, was created.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  1980s: The '80s saw the development of the Domain Name System (DNS), making it easier to navigate the growing network of networks. Instead of typing in a numerical IP address, users could type in a domain name (like [www.google.com](http://www.google.com/)), which is easier to remember. This decade also saw the establishment of important infrastructure, such as routers and Ethernet, that would make the internet more accessible to non-military users.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  1990: The World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist at CERN. The web is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the internet. With a web browser, a user can view web pages that may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia and navigate between them using hyperlinks.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  1990s: The '90s saw the rise of web browsers (like Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer) and search engines (like Yahoo and Google). This era also witnessed the dot-com boom, as businesses realized the potential of the internet for e-commerce and digital advertising.\n",

        "7.  2000s - Present: The internet continued to grow and evolve. Broadband replaced dial-up, making the internet much faster. Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter emerged, as well as video streaming platforms like YouTube. The internet also became more mobile with the rise of smartphones and tablets. The Internet of Things (IoT), which connects everyday devices to the internet, also started gaining traction.\n",

You need to put your message inside an envelope with your friend's address on it and your return address. The envelope is akin to a \"frame\" in network terms. Just like the envelope encapsulates your letter, a frame encapsulates the data to be transmitted over the network.

Devices on an Ethernet network communicate via Ethernet frames, which carry data from one device to another. These frames include source and destination MAC addresses, a payload (the data being transmitted), and an error-checking mechanism. Ethernet itself manages how devices share access to the medium (the physical wires), ensuring that if two devices try to send frames at the same time (a \"collision\"), each device will back off and try again after a random delay.\n",

        "- **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)**: Wi-Fi technology allows devices to connect to a network wirelessly. Similar to Ethernet, Wi-Fi also uses frames to transmit data, but it does so over radio waves instead of physical cables. Wi-Fi involves more complex access methods to handle multiple devices trying to communicate on the same wireless channel, but at its core, it serves a similar purpose to Ethernet - getting data frames from one device to another.\n",

It's a language that structures content on the internet and forms the building blocks of all websites. HTML does this by using tags that define the content type, such as headers, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.  Here's why we use HTML:\n",

        "    -   Link Element: This is typically used to link CSS files for styling the HTML content.\n",
        "    -   Script Element: This is used to link JavaScript files, though JavaScript can also be placed in the body.\n",
        "4.  Body Element: The `<body>` tag contains the content that is displayed on the web page.

        "| Term | Definition |\n",
        "| --- | --- |\n",
        "| Computer Network | A group of interconnected computers that allow for communication and data sharing between them. It facilitates the sharing of resources and information. |\n",
        "| Wide Area Network (WAN) | A network that spans a large geographical area, often a country or continent. It's often used to connect different local networks, allowing devices and users in one location to communicate with devices and users in another. |\n",
        "| Local Area Network (LAN) | A network that connects computers or devices in a relatively small area, such as a home, school, or office building. It's often used to share resources like files, printers, and games. |\n",
        "| Network Protocol | The rules or standard procedures that define how data is transmitted over a network. These rules dictate the way that data packets are sent, received, and responded to. |\n",
        "| TCP-IP Model | A way of analyzing networks divided into four layers: the Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application layers. |\n",
        "| Application Layer | The topmost layer in the TCP/IP model which interfaces directly with the applications we use to communicate over the network. Important protocols include HTTP, FTP, and SMTP. It's where user-provided data is managed and prepared for transport. |\n",
        "| Transport Layer | The layer in the TCP/IP model that's responsible for the end-to-end communication over the network. It manages the assembly and reassembly of data packets, error-checking, and flow control. Two primary protocols are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). |\n",
        "| Internet Layer | The second layer in the TCP/IP model. It's responsible for packet routing, IP addressing, and handling network connections. |\n",
        "| Network Interface Layer | THe lowest layer in the TCP/IP mode, concerned with how data frames are physically sent |\n",
        "| Network Interface Card (NIC) | A hardware component, also known as a network adapter, that enables a computer to connect to a network. It converts the data from the computer into a format suitable for the network cable and controls the data transfer to and from the computer. |\n",
        "| MAC Address | A unique identifier assigned to a Network Interface Card (NIC) by the manufacturer. It's used to identify devices at the physical layer in a network. MAC stands for Media Access Control. |\n",
        "| Router | A device that forwards data packets along networks. It connects at least two networks, commonly LANs or WANs, and is located at gateways, the places where two or more networks connect. |\n",
        "| Switch | A networking device that connects devices together on a computer network by using packet switching to receive, process, and forward data to the destination device. Unlike a hub, a switch only sends data to the device that it is intended for. |\n",
        "| Modem | A device that modulates an analog carrier signal to encode digital information, and also demodulates such a carrier signal to decode the transmitted information. It enables a computer to transmit data over telephone or cable lines. |\n",
        "| Network Port | An endpoint in communications, representing a specific process to which an internet or other network message is directed when it reaches a server. |\n",
        "| HTTP | The standard protocol used to transfer hypertext over the World Wide Web. It prescribes how messages are structured, transmitted, and responded to by web servers and browsers. |\n",
        "| Internet | A global system of interconnected networks using TCP/IP protocols to facilitate worldwide device linking. It serves as a platform for various information and communication facilities, including the World Wide Web. |\n",
        "| Domain Name System (DNS) | The technology that converts human-friendly domain names into numerical IP addresses, which are required for computer services and devices worldwide. |\n",
        "| Internet Cookie | A small data file stored on a user's computer by a web browser while visiting a website. It retains stateful information and tracks the user's site navigation. |\n",
        "| Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) | Part of the TCP/IP protocol suite that ensures data packets are delivered in sequence from source to destination. TCP includes error-checking to prevent data loss, making it essential for tasks where reliability is vital. |\n",
        "| User Datagram Protocol (UDP) | A communication protocol that allows data packet dispatch before the connection is verified, providing speed at the expense of reliability. Often used for fast-paced activities, such as streaming media or online gaming. |\n",
        "| Internet Protocol (IP) | The rule set governing how data is sent and received over the internet. It provides a unique identification system for machines on a network, via IP addresses. |\n",
        "| IPv4 | Fourth version of the IP, serving as the foundation of internet data communication. Its 32-bit addressing system allows approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses. |\n",
        "| IPv6 | The most recent version of the IP, designed to replace IPv4 due to exhaustion of addresses. It uses 128-bit addressing, providing a virtually limitless number of unique addresses. |\n",
        "| Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) | A standard markup language used to structure web pages and web applications. Used in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript, it enables the creation of page layouts, styles, and interactive features. |\n",
        "| Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) | A language responsible for defining the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. It stipulates styles, design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. |"
