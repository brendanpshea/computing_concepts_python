        "### Brendan Shea, PhD (Brendan.Shea@rctc.edu)\n",
        "In the simplest terms, a **network** is a collection of devices that are interconnected and can communicate with each other. These devices can range from computers, laptops, and smartphones to printers, servers, or even IoT devices like smart fridges or thermostats. The purpose of this connection is to share and exchange information and resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "A network allows for the sharing of data and resources, such as files, applications, or even hardware like printers, in a much more efficient and collaborative manner than would be possible without the network. For example, instead of storing a file on a USB drive and physically carrying it to another computer, a network allows you to send the file directly, saving time and effort.  \n",
        "\n",
        "There are two primary types of networks: Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs).\n",
        "\n",
        "- A **Local Area Network (LAN)** is a network that connects devices in a relatively small area, such as a home, office, or a group of buildings. These networks are typically owned, controlled, and managed by a single person or organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- On the other hand, a **Wide Area Network (WAN)** covers a large geographical area and connects multiple LANs together. The **internet** is the most prominent example of a WAN, which is a global network of networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Networks can also be classified based on their design approach: **Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks**, where each device has equivalent responsibilities and capabilities, or **client-server networks**, where some computers (servers) provide services, and others (clients) use those services.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, Networks operate based on established rules and **protocols**, which define how the devices should transmit and receive data. These protocols ensure that networks across the globe can communicate with each other seamlessly, leading to the interconnected world we live in today. In this lesson, you'll learn some of the most important of these protocols, including the the Internet Protocol (IP), Tranmission Control Protocol (TCP), and Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP)."

        "## How Network \"Models\" Aid Understanding\n",
        "Imagine you're trying to bake a cake without a recipe. You know you need ingredients like flour, sugar, eggs, and so on, but you don't know how much of each ingredient to use, or in what order to mix them. The result would be a disaster. A recipe guides you, telling you exactly what to do step-by-step.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a similar way, a **network model** is like a recipe for computer networks. But instead of baking a cake, we're trying to transmit data, like emails or web pages, from one device to another over the network.  Now, why do we need a network model or this \"recipe\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. *Models Help Humans Understand Networks.* Networks can be complex with many different parts working together. It's like trying to understand a busy city with all its people, cars, buses, buildings, and roads. If we tried to understand everything at once, we'd get confused. But if we break it down into parts - like people, transportation, infrastructure - it's easier to understand. Network models do the same for networks. They break down the whole process of data transfer into layers. Each layer has a specific job, making it easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  *Models Help Humans Build Networks.* When we're building networks, we want to ensure that all the parts can \"talk\" to each other - that is, they can send and receive data correctly. Network models provide a common language or standard that all parts of the network can understand and follow. This ensures that different devices, perhaps made by different companies, can still communicate with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  *Models Help Humans Fix Networks.*  Let's go back to the city example. If there's a traffic jam, we don't need to look at every person, car, or building in the city to find the problem. We just focus on the transportation - the roads and cars. Similarly, in networks, when something goes wrong, we can look at each layer separately to find and fix the problem. This makes troubleshooting much easier and faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "In simple terms, a network model helps us to understand how a network works, how to build a network so all parts can work together, and how to fix problems when they arise. Without it, creating and maintaining networks would be a lot more complicated."

        "## A Four-Layer Network Model: TCP-IP\n",
        "Think of the process of sending a letter through the postal service. You write your letter (the message), put it in an envelope (packaging), write the address (where it needs to go), and then give it to the postal service (the transportation system). The postal service then delivers the letter to the address you wrote on the envelope. The person who receives the letter opens the envelope and reads your message.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, when a device wants to send data to another device over a network, it has to go through a process. To make this process easier to understand, we break it down into steps, or layers. Each layer has a specific job to do, just like in our postal service example.  In the four-layer (**TCP-IP**) network model, these layers are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Application Layer.** This is where our \"letter\" starts. The application layer is where network applications (like your web browser or email client) live. It's what you, as the user, interact with. When an application wants to send data, it's the application layer's job to package that data so it can be sent over the network. This might include formatting a web page into HTML, turning an email into text, or converting a voice call into digital audio. It also works the other way around, converting incoming data into something the user can understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Transport Layer.** Once our \"letter\" is packaged, it needs to be delivered. That's the job of the transport layer. This layer establishes a connection between the sending and receiving devices and ensures that data is reliably sent. It does this by breaking down the data from the application layer into smaller **packets** and tracking them to ensure they all reach the destination. It's kind of like taking a large letter and breaking it down into postcards, each with a number so you can put them back together in the right order.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Internet Layer.** Now that our \"letter\" is packaged and ready for transport, we need to figure out where it's going.  The Internet layer is responsible for routing the data packets to the right destination. It adds the IP addresses of the sender and receiver to the data packets so that they can be correctly routed. In other words, it figures out the best way to get the data from the sender to the receiver, kind of like how a GPS finds the best route to your destination.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Network Interface (\"Data Link\") Layer.**  This is the final step. The Network Interface Layer is in charge of the physical transmission of data. It's like our mail carrier in the letter example. This layer takes the data packets, converts them into a form that can be transmitted physically (like electrical signals or radio waves), and sends them onto the network. It also receives incoming data and converts it back into a form the upper layers can understand. (So, incoming data needs to go through these same four steps, except \"backwards\").\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, the four-layer network model is a way of breaking down the process of sending data over a network into manageable steps, making it easier to understand and manage. It helps us understand how data gets from one application to another over a network."

        "The Application Layer, the topmost layer of the four-layer network model, encompasses protocols that users often interact with directly, albeit behind the scenes of user-friendly applications. These protocols enable activities like web browsing, email communication, and file transfers. Critical to the functioning of these protocols is the concept of \"ports.\"\n",

Ports are associated with specific processes or services in a system, and each service has a unique port number. Port numbers help the system identify the correct application or service for which the data is intended. Essentially, they are like apartment numbers in a large building, ensuring the mail (or data) gets to the correct resident (or application).\n",

        "\n",
        "The **Hyptertext Transport Protocol (HTTP)** in an application-layer protocolinvented by Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, and his team at CERN in 1989. The purpose of HTTP is to allow the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents, images, and videos, from servers and displaying them on a client's browser. Essentially, HTTP is the protocol that enables communication between web browsers (clients) and web servers, allowing us to surf the internet.\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTP is critically important because it forms the foundation of any data exchange on the web. It's not an exaggeration to say that almost every action you perform on the internet---from clicking a link, to typing a URL into your browser's address bar, to submitting a form on a webpage---starts an HTTP request.\n",
        "HTTP is based on the request-response model. That means the communication usually begins with a client (for instance, your browser) making a request to a server. The server, upon receiving this request, processes it and sends a response back to the client.  Here's a simplified step-by-step breakdown of how this works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  *The Client Sends a Request.* Let's say you want to visit `www.example.com`. When you type this URL into your browser and hit Enter, your browser starts an HTTP request. This request is a message which includes information like the desired action (often \"GET\" to fetch data, though there are other methods), the URL, and the HTTP version.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  *The Server Processes the Request.* The HTTP request message is received by the web server hosting `www.example.com`. The server processes the request, interpreting what resources are asked for and what action the client wants to perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  *The Server Sends a Response.* After processing, the server forms an HTTP response and sends it back to the client. This response includes a status code that indicates whether the request was successful (for example, \"200\" for success) or if there were any errors (for example, \"404\" means the requested page was not found). Along with the status code, if the request was successful, the server includes the requested resource in the response---for instance, the HTML of a web page.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  *The Client Displays the Response.* Once your browser receives the HTTP response, it interprets the data and renders the web page on your screen. If the requested resource is an HTML file, the browser reads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, fetches any necessary additional files (like images), and displays the formatted page for you to view.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, this is a simplified explanation. In reality, there's a lot more complexity involved, including things like HTTP headers for transmitting metadata, cookies for maintaining state, and HTTPS for securing communications. But at its heart, HTTP is about sending a request from a client to a server, and returning a response from the server back to the client. This basic model underlies much of the activity on the internet."

        "\n",
        "The Transport Layer is essential for network communication, facilitating end-to-end services between applications. It ensures reliable and transparent data transfer between end systems (hosts) through protocols like **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol).**\n",
        "\n",
        "TCP is all about reliable and orderly delivery of data packets. It's like a tracked mail service - you know your data will get there and in the order you sent it. Key features of TCP include reliable transmission (it retransmits lost or corrupted packets), flow control (managing the data transfer rate to avoid overwhelming the receiver), ordered delivery (rearranging packets that arrive out of order), and congestion control (preventing traffic bottlenecks).\n",
        "\n",
        "UDP, on the other hand, is simpler and connectionless. It's like sending a letter without tracking - faster but without guarantees of delivery or order. UDP doesn't provide TCP's reliability mechanisms, making it faster and suitable for applications where speed is more critical than precision, like live broadcasts or online games.\n",

        "## How the Internet Protocol (IP) Enables Global Connectivity\n",
        "The Internet Layer, also known as the network layer, is responsible for receiving segments from the Transport Layer and packaging them into packets. But perhaps its most significant role is addressing, routing, and forwarding these packets to allow communication between networks, hence facilitating global connectivity. Let's dive into this.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. At the heart of this process is the **Internet Protocol (IP)**, which defines the system of IP addresses. An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses IP for communication. There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. **IPv4 addresses** are composed of four sets of numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1). **IPv6 addresses**, which are being more widely used due to the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, are composed of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).  Each IP address in an IP network must be unique within that network.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The Internet Layer is also responsible for routing data packets to their destinations using IP addresses. Each **router** connected to the network has a table known as the **routing table** that stores routes (paths) to different network destinations. It uses these tables to decide the best path for forwarding the packets.  When a data packet is sent from one network to another, it usually passes through several routers. Each router examines the IP address of the packet's destination and consults its routing table to decide which way to send the packet. The packet is forwarded from router to router along the path until it reaches its destination network.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The process of sending the packets from one network to another, as decided by the routers, is known as **forwarding**. The routers at the boundary of each network are responsible for forwarding the packets to the next network on the path to the destination.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Each device connected to a network receives an IP address, which can be either public or private. A **public IP address** is a globally unique address that is assigned to a device, like a router, that connects directly to the internet. These addresses are used across the entire internet to locate networked devices. **Private IP addresses**, on the other hand, are used within private networks such as home, office, or enterprise networks. These addresses are not routable on the open internet and therefore provide a layer of security by inherently hiding the networked device from the world. Common private IPv4 address ranges include 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The combination of unique IP addressing and the capability of IP routing and forwarding enables global connectivity. Regardless of the network, each device can send packets to any other device in the world, as long as they are both connected to the internet. The packets are routed through various networks and routers on their journey, each hop getting them closer to their destination, until they ultimately reach the correct device."

        "The **Network Interface Layer**, also known as the Link or Data Link Layer, is the layer that interfaces directly with the physical network. It forms the bridge between the logical aspect of network communication, handled by the layers above it, and the physical reality of transmitting and receiving data over hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you're sending a letter to a friend. You have your message ready, but you can't just hand your words over to the mail carrier. You need to put your message inside an envelope with your friend's address on it and your return address. The envelope is akin to a \"frame\" in network terms. Just like the envelope encapsulates your letter, a frame encapsulates the data to be transmitted over the network. Each frame includes not just the data, or \"payload\", but also source and destination addresses, as well as other control information to ensure successful transmission.\n",

        "| Technology/Protocol | Description and Role |\n",
        "| --- | --- |\n",
        "| Ethernet | This is used in wired networks to connect devices like computers. It puts data into a format (called frames) for sending over cables. These frames include addresses to identify each device, the data being sent, and checks for errors. |\n",
        "| Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) | Similar to Ethernet, but for wireless networks. It sends data over air using radio signals. Just like Ethernet, it uses frames with addresses and data, but it also has special ways to deal with many devices using the same air space. |\n",
        "| MAC Addresses | These are unique numbers for every device in a network, like an ID card for each computer or phone. They help make sure the data sent over a network reaches the right device. |\n",
        "| Switches and Bridges | These are like traffic officers for networks. They look at the addresses on data and decide where to send it in the network, making sure data goes to the right device. |\n",
        "| ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) | This is used when a device knows the IP address (like a postal address for the internet) of another device but needs to find out its MAC address (the device's unique ID). |\n",
        "| PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) | A method for connecting two network devices directly, like a direct phone call between two computers. It wraps up data in a special way so it can be sent over these direct connections. |\n",
        "| Frame Relay | This is a way to send data quickly over a network, especially used in big telecommunications networks. It chops data into pieces and sends them in an efficient way to speed up delivery. |\n",
        "| VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) | This technology divides a big network into smaller, separate networks. This helps manage the network better and can keep certain data more secure. |\n",
        "\n",
        "These technologies and protocols work in tandem to ensure that data is correctly packaged into frames, sent over the physical network, and accurately delivered to the right device. This process begins with encapsulating data in Ethernet or Wi-Fi frames, which include the MAC addresses of the sending and receiving devices. If the MAC address of the receiving device isn't known, ARP is used to find it. Switches or bridges then forward these frames to the right destination within the network"

Join Network Ninja and Network Novice as they slice through the complexities of the four-layer Network Model, using \"Shadow Strike: Ninja Networks\" as their guide. (\n",
        "\n",
        "* * * * *\n",
        "\n",
        "Network Novice: Absolutely, Ninja! But networking stuff confuses me. How does our game actually connect and play so smoothly?\n",
        "\n",
        "Network Ninja: Let's break it down using the four-layer Network Model. Imagine each layer as a different ninja skill level.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Level 1: Link Layer - \"The Hardware Connection\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Network Ninja: First up is the Link Layer. Think of it as your game console connecting to the internet. Your Android device uses Wi-Fi or mobile data to connect, similar to attaching your nunchucks to your ninja belt.\n",
        "\n",
        "Network Novice: Got it! My phone's Wi-Fi connects to the router, like hooking up to the ninja network.\n",

        "\n",
        "Network Ninja: Next, the Internet Layer. Here's where IP addresses come in. Your phone gets an IP address, like a home address in the ninja village. When you play \"Shadow Strike,\" your game data is sent in packets to the IP address of the server where other ninjas are playing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Network Novice: So, it's like sending a ninja scroll to a specific location in the village. But how does it find the fastest route?\n",
        "\n",
        "Network Ninja: Exactly! The Internet Layer figures out the most efficient path for your data packets, just like a ninja choosing the quickest rooftops to leap across.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Level 3: Transport Layer - \"The Trustworthy Courier\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Network Ninja: Then comes the Transport Layer. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures your game's moves are sent reliably. Think of TCP like a trustworthy courier, making sure every part of your secret message gets to the other ninjas.\n",
        "\n",
        "Network Novice: And what about UDP? I heard it's faster?\n",
        "\n",
        "Network Ninja: Good point! UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is like a swift messenger bird. It's faster but doesn't check if all parts of the message arrived. In \"Shadow Strike,\" UDP might be used for real-time updates where speed is crucial, and it's okay if a move or two gets lost in the fray.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Level 4: Application Layer - \"The Art of Shadow Strike\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Network Ninja: Finally, we reach the Application Layer. This is \"Shadow Strike\" itself. Here, specific port numbers are like doors to different rooms in our ninja castle. Our game might use a particular port number, say 5555, to ensure that when your device connects to the game server, it goes straight to \"Shadow Strike\" and not some other game.\n",
        "\n",
        "Network Novice: Ah, so when I launch the game, it uses that port number to enter the right room in the castle where all the ninjas gather!\n",
        "\n",
        "Network Ninja: Precisely! And with all these layers working together, from your Wi-Fi connection to the game server, we ensure a seamless and swift ninja gaming experience.\n",

        "**Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It's a language that structures content on the internet and forms the building blocks of all websites. HTML does this by using tags that define the content type, such as headers, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.  Here's why we use HTML:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Universal Internet Language: HTML is universally understood by browsers across platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) and devices (desktop, laptop, mobile, etc.). This makes it essential for creating content on the internet.\n",

        "2.  Structure and Content of Web Pages: HTML provides the structure to web pages. It allows you to define various elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, images, forms, etc., making your content readable and understandable by web browsers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Embed Media: HTML allows embedding various types of media like images, videos, audio, etc., into the web page.\n",

        "\n",
        "    -   Title Element: The `<title>` tag specifies the title of the web page. The title is what shows up in the browser tab and is also used by search engines.\n",
        "    -   Meta Tags: These include various details about the HTML document. This could be character encoding declaration (like `<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">`), information for search engine (like meta description), and viewport settings for responsive design.\n",

        "| Computer Network | A group of interconnected computers that allow for communication and data sharing between them. It facilitates the sharing of resources and information. |\n",
        "| Wide Area Network (WAN) | A network that spans a large geographical area, often a country or continent. It's often used to connect different local networks, allowing devices and users in one location to communicate with devices and users in another. |\n",
        "| Local Area Network (LAN) | A network that connects computers or devices in a relatively small area, such as a home, school, or office building. It's often used to share resources like files, printers, and games. |\n",
        "| Network Protocol | The rules or standard procedures that define how data is transmitted over a network. These rules dictate the way that data packets are sent, received, and responded to. |\n",
        "| TCP-IP Model | A way of analyzing networks divided into four layers: the Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application layers. |\n",
        "| Application Layer | The topmost layer in the TCP/IP model which interfaces directly with the applications we use to communicate over the network. Important protocols include HTTP, FTP, and SMTP. It's where user-provided data is managed and prepared for transport. |\n",
        "| Transport Layer | The layer in the TCP/IP model that's responsible for the end-to-end communication over the network. It manages the assembly and reassembly of data packets, error-checking, and flow control. Two primary protocols are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). |\n",
        "| Internet Layer | The second layer in the TCP/IP model. It's responsible for packet routing, IP addressing, and handling network connections. |\n",
        "| Network Interface Layer | THe lowest layer in the TCP/IP mode, concerned with how data frames are physically sent |\n",
        "| Network Interface Card (NIC) | A hardware component, also known as a network adapter, that enables a computer to connect to a network. It converts the data from the computer into a format suitable for the network cable and controls the data transfer to and from the computer. |\n",
        "| MAC Address | A unique identifier assigned to a Network Interface Card (NIC) by the manufacturer. It's used to identify devices at the physical layer in a network. MAC stands for Media Access Control. |\n",
        "| Router | A device that forwards data packets along networks. It connects at least two networks, commonly LANs or WANs, and is located at gateways, the places where two or more networks connect. |\n",
        "| Switch | A networking device that connects devices together on a computer network by using packet switching to receive, process, and forward data to the destination device. Unlike a hub, a switch only sends data to the device that it is intended for. |\n",
        "| Modem | A device that modulates an analog carrier signal to encode digital information, and also demodulates such a carrier signal to decode the transmitted information. It enables a computer to transmit data over telephone or cable lines. |\n",
        "| Network Port | An endpoint in communications, representing a specific process to which an internet or other network message is directed when it reaches a server. |\n",
        "| HTTP | The standard protocol used to transfer hypertext over the World Wide Web. It prescribes how messages are structured, transmitted, and responded to by web servers and browsers. |\n",
        "| Internet | A global system of interconnected networks using TCP/IP protocols to facilitate worldwide device linking. It serves as a platform for various information and communication facilities, including the World Wide Web. |\n",
        "| Domain Name System (DNS) | The technology that converts human-friendly domain names into numerical IP addresses, which are required for computer services and devices worldwide. |\n",
        "| Internet Cookie | A small data file stored on a user's computer by a web browser while visiting a website. It retains stateful information and tracks the user's site navigation. |\n",
        "| Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) | Part of the TCP/IP protocol suite that ensures data packets are delivered in sequence from source to destination. TCP includes error-checking to prevent data loss, making it essential for tasks where reliability is vital. |\n",
        "| User Datagram Protocol (UDP) | A communication protocol that allows data packet dispatch before the connection is verified, providing speed at the expense of reliability. Often used for fast-paced activities, such as streaming media or online gaming. |\n",
        "| Internet Protocol (IP) | The rule set governing how data is sent and received over the internet. It provides a unique identification system for machines on a network, via IP addresses. |\n",
        "| IPv4 | Fourth version of the IP, serving as the foundation of internet data communication. Its 32-bit addressing system allows approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses. |\n",
        "| IPv6 | The most recent version of the IP, designed to replace IPv4 due to exhaustion of addresses. It uses 128-bit addressing, providing a virtually limitless number of unique addresses. |\n",
        "| Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) | A standard markup language used to structure web pages and web applications. Used in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript, it enables the creation of page layouts, styles, and interactive features. |\n",
        "| Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) | A language responsible for defining the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. It stipulates styles, design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. |"
