        "### Computing Concepts with Python | Brendan Shea, PhD (Brendan.Shea@rctc.edu)\n",
        "In the simplest terms, a **network** is a collection of devices that are interconnected and can communicate with each other. These devices can range from computers, laptops, and smartphones to printers, servers, or even IoT devices like smart fridges or thermostats. The purpose of this connection is to share and exchange information and resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "A network allows for the sharing of data and resources, such as files, applications, or even hardware like printers, in a much more efficient and collaborative manner than would be possible without the network. For example, instead of storing a file on a USB drive and physically carrying it to another computer, a network allows you to send the file directly, saving time and effort.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, you'll learn to do the following when it comes to networks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Define what a computer network is and differentiate between Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs).\n",
        "2.  Explain the four layers of the TCP/IP network model (Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Interface) and describe the role and key protocols of each layer.\n",
        "3.  Understand how data is routed across the internet using IP addresses and the role of the Domain Name System (DNS) in translating domain names to IP addresses.\n",
        "4.  Compare and contrast the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and explain when each might be used.\n",
        "5.  Create a basic webpage using HTML, including elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and tables.\n",
        "6.  Apply basic CSS styling to an HTML webpage, using properties like color, font, alignment, margins, and padding."

        "## Types of Networks\n",
        "There are two primary types of networks: Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs).\n",
        "\n",
        "- A **Local Area Network (LAN)** is a network that connects devices in a relatively small area, such as a home, office, or a group of buildings. These networks are typically owned, controlled, and managed by a single person or organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- On the other hand, a **Wide Area Network (WAN)** covers a large geographical area and connects multiple LANs together. The **internet** is the most prominent example of a WAN, which is a global network of networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Networks can also be classified based on their design approach: **Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks**, where each device has equivalent responsibilities and capabilities, or **client-server networks**, where some computers (servers) provide services, and others (clients) use those services.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, Networks operate based on established rules and **protocols**, which define how the devices should transmit and receive data. These protocols ensure that networks across the globe can communicate with each other seamlessly, leading to the interconnected world we live in today. In this lesson, you'll learn some of the most important of these protocols, including the the Internet Protocol (IP), Tranmission Control Protocol (TCP), and Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP)."

        "## Intro to the TCP/IP Network Model\n",
        "\n",
        "In computer networking, it's essential to have a clear understanding of how data is transmitted from one device to another. Just like sending a letter, there are several steps involved in the process, and each step plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data reaches its intended destination. To simplify this complex process, network models were developed. These models break down the communication process into layers, each with its own set of responsibilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we'll explore the  TCP/IP (\"four-layer network\") model, using the analogy of Wesley writing a letter to Buttercup (from the *Princess Bride*). We can think of person as a network \"node\", their letters as the \"data\" they are sending, and the postal service as the connections between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "The four-layer network model consists of the following layers: Application, Transport, Network, and (Data) Link. Let's dive into each layer and see how they relate to our letter-sending analogy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Application Layer** is the topmost layer of the four-layer network model. It is responsible for providing services to the user and defining how the user interacts with the data. In our analogy, this layer represents Wesley composing the letter to Buttercup. Wesley is using a specific format (e.g., a love letter) and language (e.g., English) to express his message. Some key terms associated with this layer include:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A **protocol** is a set of rules governing the format and meaning of the data being transmitted. In our example, the protocol could be the specific way Wesley writes his love letter (e.g., starting with \"My dearest Buttercup,\"). In the world of computers, it might HTTP (for websites), IMAP or POP (for mail), or others.\n",
        "-   An **application** is the the software that generates the data to be transmitted. In this case, it could be a word processor Wesley uses to write the letter. In computer networks, this might be a web browers (like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox), a web server (like Apache), an email client (Outlook), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Transport Layer** is responsible for ensuring reliable data transfer between the source and the destination. It breaks the data into smaller, manageable pieces called **segments** and reassembles them at the receiving end. This layer also provides two main protocols: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **TCP** is like sending a letter via registered mail. When Wesley sends his letter using TCP, he expects an acknowledgment from Buttercup that she has received the letter. If Wesley doesn't receive the acknowledgment, he will resend the letter until he gets confirmation. TCP ensures reliable data delivery, error correction, and flow control. In the world of computers, this is what we use for things like web pages and email (where we care a lot about seeing *accurate* text).\n",
        "- On the other hand, **UDP** is like sending a postcard. When Wesley sends his message using UDP, he doesn't expect an acknowledgment from Buttercup. UDP is faster than TCP but does not guarantee reliable delivery or error correction. In computer networks, we use this for things like streaming video (where we are willing to sacrifice accuracy for speed).\n",
        "- **Ports** play a crucial role in allowing the Transport Layer to \"communicate with\" the application layer. They are like mailboxes for different applications. Each application on a device is assigned a unique port number. In our analogy,  maybe Wesley draws \"heart\" on his letter to let Buttercup know what \"type\" of letter it is, and maybe a bit about where and when she should open it. By contrast, she might approach an envelope that appears to contain legal documents quite differently! This process allows multiple applications to run simultaneously on a single device without confusion.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Network Layer**  is responsible for addressing and routing the data packets across different networks. It ensures that the data reaches its intended destination by using logical addresses (IP addresses). In our analogy, this layer represents Wesley writing Buttercup's address on the envelope and handing it over to the postal service. The postal service then uses the address to determine the best route for the letter to reach Buttercup. Key terms include:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   An **IP Address** is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, similar to a postal address.\n",
        "-   **Routing** is the process of determining the best path for data to travel from source to destination.\n",
        "-   A **packet** is a unit of data that includes both the data itself and the necessary addressing information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Data Link Layer**  is responsible for the reliable transfer of data between two directly connected devices. It encapsulates the packets into frames and handles error detection and correction. In our analogy, this layer represents the postal service physically delivering the letter to Buttercup's mailbox. Key terms include:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A **frame** is the basic unit of data transfer at the Link Layer, which includes the packet and additional header information.\n",

        "-   **Error detection** is the process of identifying and correcting errors that may occur during data transmission.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the letter reaches Buttercup's device, it goes back \"up\" the four-layer network model, from the data link layer (receiving the letter), network layer (reading the address and finding it is from Wesley), transport layer (seeing whether she needs to send a return receipt, and figuring what \"type\" of letter it will be) to application layer (reading the letter and responding."

        "\n",
        "The **Hyptertext Transport Protocol (HTTP)** in an application-layer protocolinvented by Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, and his team at CERN in 1989. The purpose of HTTP is to allow the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents, images, and videos, from servers and displaying them on a client's browser. Essentially, HTTP is the protocol that enables communication between web browsers (clients) and web servers, allowing us to surf the internet.\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTP is critically important because it forms the foundation of any data exchange on the web. It's not an exaggeration to say that almost every action you perform on the internet---from clicking a link, to typing a URL into your browser's address bar, to submitting a form on a webpage---starts an HTTP request.\n",
        "HTTP is based on the request-response model. That means the communication usually begins with a client (for instance, your browser) making a request to a server. The server, upon receiving this request, processes it and sends a response back to the client.  Here's a simplified step-by-step breakdown of how this works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  *The Client Sends a Request.* Let's say you want to visit `www.example.com`. When you type this URL into your browser and hit Enter, your browser starts an HTTP request. This request is a message which includes information like the desired action (often \"GET\" to fetch data, though there are other methods), the URL, and the HTTP version.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  *The Server Processes the Request.* The HTTP request message is received by the web server hosting `www.example.com`. The server processes the request, interpreting what resources are asked for and what action the client wants to perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  *The Server Sends a Response.* After processing, the server forms an HTTP response and sends it back to the client. This response includes a status code that indicates whether the request was successful (for example, \"200\" for success) or if there were any errors (for example, \"404\" means the requested page was not found). Along with the status code, if the request was successful, the server includes the requested resource in the response---for instance, the HTML of a web page.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  *The Client Displays the Response.* Once your browser receives the HTTP response, it interprets the data and renders the web page on your screen. If the requested resource is an HTML file, the browser reads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, fetches any necessary additional files (like images), and displays the formatted page for you to view.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, this is a simplified explanation. In reality, there's a lot more complexity involved, including things like HTTP headers for transmitting metadata, cookies for maintaining state, and HTTPS for securing communications. But at its heart, HTTP is about sending a request from a client to a server, and returning a response from the server back to the client. This basic model underlies much of the activity on the internet."

        "\n",
        "The Transport Layer is essential for network communication, facilitating end-to-end services between applications. It ensures reliable and transparent data transfer between end systems (hosts) through protocols like **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol).**\n",
        "\n",
        "TCP is all about reliable and orderly delivery of data packets. It's like a tracked mail service - you know your data will get there and in the order you sent it. Key features of TCP include reliable transmission (it retransmits lost or corrupted packets), flow control (managing the data transfer rate to avoid overwhelming the receiver), ordered delivery (rearranging packets that arrive out of order), and congestion control (preventing traffic bottlenecks).\n",
        "\n",
        "UDP, on the other hand, is simpler and connectionless. It's like sending a letter without tracking - faster but without guarantees of delivery or order. UDP doesn't provide TCP's reliability mechanisms, making it faster and suitable for applications where speed is more critical than precision, like live broadcasts or online games.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both TCP and UDP use port numbers to direct data to the correct application on a network device. Key features of these protocols include:\n",

        "## How the Internet Protocol (IP) Enables Global Connectivity\n",
        "The Internet Layer, also known as the network layer, is responsible for receiving segments from the Transport Layer and packaging them into packets. But perhaps its most significant role is addressing, routing, and forwarding these packets to allow communication between networks, hence facilitating global connectivity. Let's dive into this.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. At the heart of this process is the **Internet Protocol (IP)**, which defines the system of IP addresses. An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses IP for communication. There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. **IPv4 addresses** are composed of four sets of numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1). **IPv6 addresses**, which are being more widely used due to the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, are composed of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).  Each IP address in an IP network must be unique within that network.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The Internet Layer is also responsible for routing data packets to their destinations using IP addresses. Each **router** connected to the network has a table known as the **routing table** that stores routes (paths) to different network destinations. It uses these tables to decide the best path for forwarding the packets.  When a data packet is sent from one network to another, it usually passes through several routers. Each router examines the IP address of the packet's destination and consults its routing table to decide which way to send the packet. The packet is forwarded from router to router along the path until it reaches its destination network.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The process of sending the packets from one network to another, as decided by the routers, is known as **forwarding**. The routers at the boundary of each network are responsible for forwarding the packets to the next network on the path to the destination.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Each device connected to a network receives an IP address, which can be either public or private. A **public IP address** is a globally unique address that is assigned to a device, like a router, that connects directly to the internet. These addresses are used across the entire internet to locate networked devices. **Private IP addresses**, on the other hand, are used within private networks such as home, office, or enterprise networks. These addresses are not routable on the open internet and therefore provide a layer of security by inherently hiding the networked device from the world. Common private IPv4 address ranges include 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The combination of unique IP addressing and the capability of IP routing and forwarding enables global connectivity. Regardless of the network, each device can send packets to any other device in the world, as long as they are both connected to the internet. The packets are routed through various networks and routers on their journey, each hop getting them closer to their destination, until they ultimately reach the correct device."

        "The **Network Interface Layer**, also known as the Link or Data Link Layer, is the layer that interfaces directly with the physical network. It forms the bridge between the logical aspect of network communication, handled by the layers above it, and the physical reality of transmitting and receiving data over hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you're sending a letter to a friend. You have your message ready, but you can't just hand your words over to the mail carrier. You need to put your message inside an envelope with your friend's address on it and your return address. The envelope is akin to a \"frame\" in network terms. Just like the envelope encapsulates your letter, a frame encapsulates the data to be transmitted over the network. Each frame includes not just the data, or \"payload\", but also source and destination addresses, as well as other control information to ensure successful transmission.\n",

        "\n",
        "| Technology/Protocol | Description and Role |\n",
        "| --- | --- |\n",
        "| Ethernet | This is used in wired networks to connect devices like computers. It puts data into a format (called frames) for sending over cables. These frames include addresses to identify each device, the data being sent, and checks for errors. |\n",
        "| Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) | Similar to Ethernet, but for wireless networks. It sends data over air using radio signals. Just like Ethernet, it uses frames with addresses and data, but it also has special ways to deal with many devices using the same air space. |\n",
        "| MAC Addresses | These are unique numbers for every device in a network, like an ID card for each computer or phone. They help make sure the data sent over a network reaches the right device. |\n",
        "| Switches and Bridges | These are like traffic officers for networks. They look at the addresses on data and decide where to send it in the network, making sure data goes to the right device. |\n",
        "| ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) | This is used when a device knows the IP address (like a postal address for the internet) of another device but needs to find out its MAC address (the device's unique ID). |\n",
        "| PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) | A method for connecting two network devices directly, like a direct phone call between two computers. It wraps up data in a special way so it can be sent over these direct connections. |\n",
        "| Frame Relay | This is a way to send data quickly over a network, especially used in big telecommunications networks. It chops data into pieces and sends them in an efficient way to speed up delivery. |\n",
        "| VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) | This technology divides a big network into smaller, separate networks. This helps manage the network better and can keep certain data more secure. |\n",
        "\n",
        "These technologies and protocols work in tandem to ensure that data is correctly packaged into frames, sent over the physical network, and accurately delivered to the right device. This process begins with encapsulating data in Ethernet or Wi-Fi frames, which include the MAC addresses of the sending and receiving devices. If the MAC address of the receiving device isn't known, ARP is used to find it. Switches or bridges then forward these frames to the right destination within the network"

        "## FAQ: The Network Ninja's Guide to the Four-Layer Network Model\n",
        "\n",
        "Greetings, aspiring network warriors! I am the Network Ninja, here to unveil the mysteries of the Four-Layer Network Model. Prepare to see the invisible structures that govern our digital realm!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q1: What happens at the Network Access Layer?\n",
        "\n",
        "Young grasshopper, the Network Access Layer is like the foundational kata of networking. It's where physical and electrical signals become the building blocks of digital communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine a Shaolin monastery where monks train in a secret courtyard. The courtyard itself is like the physical medium - be it Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi signals. The monks' movements represent the electrical signals carrying data.\n",
        "\n",
        "When two monks spar, they must agree on the rules of engagement. Similarly, devices at this layer must agree on:\n",
        "1. Signal voltage levels (like the force of a punch)\n",
        "2. Timing of signals (like the rhythm of attacks)\n",
        "3. Physical connector shapes (like the specific fighting stance)\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in Ethernet:\n",
        "- The cable is the courtyard\n",
        "- Electrical pulses are the monks' movements\n",
        "- The RJ45 connector shape is the agreed-upon fighting stance\n",
        "\n",
        "Just as a Shaolin monk must master the basic forms before learning advanced techniques, networking starts with these fundamental physical interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q2: How does the Internet Layer direct data across networks?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ah, this layer is where we learn the art of IP addressing and routing - the equivalent of a ninja's stealth and navigation skills.\n",
        "\n",
        "Picture our digital realm as a vast landscape of hidden ninja clans. Each clan (network) has a secret location (network address), and each ninja (device) has a unique codename (IP address).\n",
        "\n",
        "IP addressing is like assigning these codenames. For instance, 192.168.1.1 might be \"Swift Crane of the Southern Lake.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Routing is the ninja's art of secretly passing messages between clans. Routers are like master ninjas who know the secret paths between all clans. When a message needs to travel, it's passed to these master ninjas, who determine the best path:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. They look at the destination IP (the recipient's codename)\n",
        "2. They consult their secret map (routing table)\n",
        "3. They choose the best next hop, considering factors like speed and secrecy\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if a message from 192.168.1.1 (\"Swift Crane\") needs to reach 10.0.0.1 (\"Silent Wolf of the Northern Mountain\"):\n",
        "1. The router sees it's for a different clan (network)\n",
        "2. It checks its map and sees it must pass through the Misty Forest Gateway (another router)\n",
        "3. It wraps the message in a new envelope (packet) addressed to the Misty Forest Gateway\n",
        "4. The Misty Forest Gateway then passes it to the Northern Mountain clan\n",
        "\n",
        "This process continues, hop by hop, until the message reaches its destination, just as ninjas might pass a secret scroll across the land.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q3: How does the Transport Layer ensure reliable communication?\n",
        "\n",
        "This layer, young one, is where we master the arts of TCP and UDP - the yin and yang of data transport.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine two samurai clans exchanging messages. They have two methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): The way of the meticulous scribe\n",
        "2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol): The way of the swift messenger\n",
        "\n",
        "TCP is like a careful scribe copying an important scroll:\n",
        "- He numbers each section (sequence numbers)\n",
        "- He waits for confirmation before writing the next part (acknowledgments)\n",
        "- If a section is smudged, he rewrites it (retransmission)\n",
        "- He ensures the sections are in order (in-order delivery)\n",
        "- He adjusts his writing speed to match the reader's pace (flow control)\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, when downloading a file:\n",
        "1. Your computer sends a request: \"Send scroll section 1\"\n",
        "2. The server sends section 1\n",
        "3. Your computer confirms: \"Received section 1, send section 2\"\n",
        "4. This continues until the entire scroll is transmitted\n",
        "\n",
        "UDP, on the other hand, is like a swift messenger delivering short, urgent notes:\n",
        "- He doesn't wait for confirmation\n",
        "- He doesn't guarantee the order of delivery\n",
        "- He doesn't resend lost messages\n",
        "\n",
        "This is useful for real-time applications like video calls, where speed is more important than perfect accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q4: What role does the Application Layer play?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Application Layer, my student, is where the higher arts of networking are practiced. It's like the secret techniques that turn a fighter into a true master.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of the lower layers as the basic combat skills. The Application Layer is where these skills are applied to achieve specific goals - like how a samurai might use his sword skills for calligraphy, tea ceremony, or battlefield strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we have protocols like:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. HTTP/HTTPS: The art of retrieving scrolls (web pages)\n",
        "   - HTTP is like sending an open messenger to a public library\n",
        "   - HTTPS is like sending a ninja with a secret code to a hidden archive\n",
        "\n",
        "2. FTP: The technique of exchanging large scrolls (file transfer)\n",
        "   - Like two clans exchanging chests of documents, with a specific etiquette for requesting, sending, and receiving\n",
        "\n",
        "3. SMTP/POP3/IMAP: The methods of sending and receiving secret messages (email)\n",
        "   - SMTP is like the clan's outgoing messenger service\n",
        "   - POP3/IMAP are like different ways of managing your incoming message scroll\n",
        "\n",
        "4. DNS: The secret directory of clan locations\n",
        "   - Instead of memorizing \"Silent Wolf lives in the Northern Mountain at 10.0.0.1\"\n",
        "   - You just need to know \"SilentWolf.NorthernMountain.com\"\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, when you enter \"www.ninjadojo.com\" in your browser:\n",
        "1. Your computer consults DNS to find the IP address (clan location)\n",
        "2. It then uses HTTP to request the webpage (scroll) from that address\n",
        "3. The data is broken into packets (scroll sections) and sent via TCP\n",
        "4. Lower layers handle the transmission details\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, young grasshopper, as the great master Bruce Lee said, \"Absorb what is useful, discard what is not, add what is uniquely your own.\" Each layer builds upon the others, creating the complex and powerful system we call the Internet."

        "**Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It's a language that structures content on the internet and forms the building blocks of all websites. HTML does this by using tags that define the content type, such as headers, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.  Here's why we use HTML:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   HTML is universally understood by browsers across platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) and devices (desktop, laptop, mobile, etc.). This makes it essential for creating content on the internet.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   HTML provides the structure to web pages. It allows you to define various elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, images, forms, etc., making your content readable and understandable by web browsers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.   HTML allows embedding various types of media like images, videos, audio, etc., into the web page.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.   HTML allows web pages to connect to each other via hyperlinks, thus creating the \"web\" of connections that is the internet.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  Other technologies like CSS and JavaScript are often used in combination with HTML. CSS is used to control the look and feel of the HTML content, and JavaScript is used to add interactivity to HTML web pages.\n",
        "\n",

        "## Introduction to CSS\n",
        "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. While HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage, CSS enhances its visual appearance and layout. CSS allows web developers to separate the presentation of a webpage from its structure, making it easier to maintain and update the design across multiple pages.\n",
        "\n",
        "CSS works by associating style rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A style rule consists of a selector (which identifies the HTML elements to be styled) and a declaration block (which contains one or more declarations, each consisting of a property and a value).\n",
        "\n",
        "```css\n",
        "p  {    \n",
        "  color:  blue;    \n",
        "  font-size:  16px;  }\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the selector is `p`, which means the rule applies to all `<p>` (paragraph) elements in the HTML document. The declaration block is enclosed in curly braces `{}` and contains two declarations: `color: blue;` (which sets the text color to blue) and `font-size: 16px;` (which sets the font size to 16 pixels).\n",
        "\n",
        "CSS can be included in an HTML document in three ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  *Inline CSS.* Style attributes are added directly to the HTML elements using the `style` attribute.\n",
        "2.  *Internal CSS.* Style rules are placed within the `<style>` element in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.\n",
        "3.  *External CSS.* Style rules are written in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` element in the `<head>` section.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using external CSS files is generally considered the best practice, as it allows for the separation of concerns and makes maintenance easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "CSS provides a wide range of properties for styling various aspects of HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, backgrounds, margins, padding, borders, positioning, and more. It also supports advanced features like media queries (for responsive design), animations, and transitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "By leveraging the power of CSS, web developers can create visually appealing, well-structured, and maintainable websites. CSS plays a crucial role in modern web development and is an essential skill for any web developer to master.\n",

        "- Style your lists differently (e.g., change bullet points, add spacing)\n",
        "- Add hover effects to your links\n",
        "- Create a class for special text and apply a unique style to it\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 10: Add Simple JavaScript\n",
        "Add a `<script>` tag at the end of your `<body>`. Write JavaScript to:\n",
