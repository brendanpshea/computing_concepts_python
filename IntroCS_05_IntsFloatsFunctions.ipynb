Data types are an essential building block in programming, as they help us understand and organize the different kinds of information our code will work with.

        "3.  Recognize potential errors that can arise from data type mismatches and use type casting to convert between types when needed.\n",
        "4.  Define custom functions in Python using the def keyword, specifying parameters and return values.\n",

        "| Float (`float`) | A number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals. | `y = 7.5` |\n",
        "| String (`str`) | A sequence of Unicode characters. Enclosed in either single quotes or double quotes. | `name = \"Carnap\"` |\n",
        "| Boolean (`bool`) | Data type with two built-in values: `True` or `False`. | `is_true = False` |\n",
        "| List (`list`) | A collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. | `fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']` |\n",
        "| Tuple (`tuple`) | A collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members. | `colors = ('red', 'blue', 'green')` |\n",
        "| Set (`set`) | A collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members. | `cars = {'Toyota', 'Ford', 'Tesla'}` |\n",
        "| Dictionary (`dict`) | A collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members. It's a key-value pair. | `student = {'name': 'Carnap', 'age': 20}` |\n",

        "\n",
        "Computers fundamentally operate using **binary** (base-2) numbers, which are composed of only two digits: 0 and 1. These binary digits, or **bits**, form the foundation of digital data representation and processing. Each bit can be thought of as a simple switch that is either off (0) or on (1). By combining multiple bits, computers can represent more complex data, including integers.\n",

        "### Understanding Bits and Bytes\n",
        "\n",
        "As we discussed earlier, a **byte** is a common unit of digital information that consists of eight bits. In an 8-bit system, each byte can represent a wide range of values by combining the bits in different configurations. The number of possible combinations of 8 bits is 282^828, or 256. This means an 8-bit system can represent 256 distinct values.\n",

        "\n",
        "While integers are straightforward to store using binary representation, **floating point numbers** (which include fractions and real numbers) require a more complex system. Computers use a standard called the **IEEE 754** for representing floating point numbers. This standard allows for a wide range of values, including very small and very large numbers, by using scientific notation in binary form.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Components of Floating Point Representation\n",
        "\n",
        "A floating point number in an 8-bit system can be divided into three main components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Sign bit (S)**: This bit determines whether the number is positive or negative. If the sign bit is 0, the number is positive; if it is 1, the number is negative.\n",
        "2.  **Exponent (E)**: This part stores the exponent in a biased form, allowing both positive and negative exponents.\n",
        "3.  **Mantissa (M)** or **Significand**: This part represents the significant digits of the number.\n",
        "\n",
        "For simplicity, let's use a hypothetical 8-bit system with the following bit allocation:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   1 bit for the sign\n",
        "-   3 bits for the exponent\n",
        "-   4 bits for the mantissa\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example Representation\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the floating point number 12.5. In binary, 12.5 is represented as 1100.11100.11100.1. To store this in floating point format, we normalize it to scientific notation: 1.1001×231.1001 \\times 2^31.1001×23.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's break it down into the components for our 8-bit system:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Sign bit (S)**: 0 (since 12.5 is positive)\n",
        "-   **Exponent (E)**: The exponent is 3. To store it, we use a bias. For a 3-bit exponent, a common bias is 3 (since 23-1-1=32^{3-1} - 1 = 323-1-1=3). Thus, the biased exponent is 3+3=63 + 3 = 63+3=6, or 110 in binary.\n",
        "-   **Mantissa (M)**: The significant digits after the leading 1 are 1001.\n",

        "Here is a table showing the representation of some floating point numbers in this 8-bit system:\n",

        "In this table, the leftmost column shows the decimal value, followed by its binary representation. The next columns break down the floating point representation into sign, exponent, and mantissa.\n",

        "#### Normalization and Precision\n",
        "\n",
        "Normalization ensures that the binary number is always in a consistent format, which simplifies comparison and arithmetic operations.

        "#### Special Values\n",
        "\n",
        "The IEEE 754 standard also includes representations for special values:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Zero**: Represented with all exponent and mantissa bits set to 0.\n",
        "-   **Infinity**: Represented with all exponent bits set to 1 and all mantissa bits set to 0. The sign bit determines whether it is positive or negative infinity.\n",
        "-   **NaN (Not a Number)**: Represented with all exponent bits set to 1 and a non-zero mantissa.\n",
        "\n",
