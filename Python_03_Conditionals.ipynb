        "# Python: Conditionals\n",
        "In this lesson, we'll be exploring how conditionals can be used to control \"program flow.\" First, though, we're going to explore how Python \"works\" at a somewhat deeper level.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How Do Computers \"Run\" Programs?\n",
        "When you hit \"run\" on a Jupyter cell, a series of steps take place behind the scenes to execute the code in the cell. Let's break down the process into simpler steps, so it's easier to understand how the computer interprets Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Code in the cell: First, you write the Python code in a Jupyter Notebook cell. The code might include variables, functions, loops, or other programming constructs.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "x = 5\n",
        "y = 7\n",
        "result = x + y\n",
        "print(result)\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Running the cell: When you hit \"run\" (or press Shift + Enter), Jupyter sends the code in the cell to the Python interpreter, which is a special program that understands and processes Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Parsing and tokenizing: The Python interpreter starts by reading the code and breaking it down into smaller pieces called tokens. Tokens are the basic building blocks of the code, like keywords (e.g., print, if, while), variable names, operators, and literals (e.g., numbers or strings). This process is called tokenization.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Parsing: After tokenization, the interpreter checks the syntax of the code to make sure it follows Python's rules. If there are any syntax errors, the interpreter raises an exception, and you'll see an error message in the output. If the syntax is correct, the interpreter moves on to the next step.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Compilation: The Python interpreter then compiles the parsed code into an intermediate format called bytecode. Bytecode is a lower-level representation of your code that's easier for the computer to understand and execute.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Execution: Finally, the Python interpreter executes the bytecode. It processes each instruction in the bytecode one by one and performs the corresponding operations. For example, it might store values in memory, perform calculations, or call functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our example, the interpreter would:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Store the value 5 in the variable x.\n",
        "* Store the value 7 in the variable y.\n",
        "* Add the values of x and y, and store the result (12) in the variable result.\n",
        "* Call the print() function to display the value of result.\n",
        "* Output: Once the code has been executed, any output generated by the code (e.g., from print() statements) will be displayed in the Jupyter Notebook cell output area.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, when you hit \"run\" on a Jupyter cell, the computer goes through several steps to interpret and execute your Python code. It reads and checks the code, compiles it into bytecode, and then executes the bytecode step by step to perform the operations you've written in your code. Finally, it displays the output in the Notebook."

        "# How Does Python Compare to Other Languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "To get a sense of what makes Python \"unique\",  it will be helpful to compare this to two other common lanagues: Java and C. These three languages represent distinct ways of \"approaching\" computer science problems, and each come with their own strengths and weaknesses. The comparision will also allow us to think about **abstraction**, an important concept in computer science.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a high-level programming language that provides a lot of abstraction, making it easier to write code and focus on solving problems. It's known for its readability and simplicity, making it a great choice for beginners and for quickly prototyping ideas.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is an interpreted language, which means that the Python interpreter reads and executes the code directly, line by line. This makes Python relatively easy to debug and allows for rapid development. However, interpreted languages like Python may not be as fast as compiled languages since the code is translated during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Java:\n",
        "\n",
        "Java is another high-level programming language that provides a good amount of abstraction, though not as much as Python. Java is an object-oriented language, which encourages modeling real-world objects using classes and objects. This approach can make it easier to design and build large, complex applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Java has an in-between status when it comes to execution: it is a compiled language, but it's not compiled to native machine code like C. Instead, Java code is compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode, which is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM interprets the bytecode and translates it into machine code for the specific platform it's running on. This allows Java programs to run on any platform with a JVM without needing to be recompiled. The trade-off is that Java programs might be slightly slower than natively compiled languages like C, but the JVM's Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation can help optimize performance during runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "## C:\n",
        "\n",
        "C is a lower-level programming language that provides less abstraction than Python or Java. This means that when you write C code, you often need to manage more details about how the computer hardware works, such as memory management and pointers.\n",
        "\n",
        "C is a compiled language, which means that the C source code is compiled directly into native machine code for a specific platform. This machine code is then executed by the computer's hardware. Because C programs are compiled directly to native machine code, they often run faster than interpreted languages like Python or languages that use a virtual machine like Java. However, this means that C programs need to be recompiled for each platform they're intended to run on.\n",
        "\n",
        "It has been said **\"There are only three languages: C, Java, and Python.\"** Taken literally, this is certainly false! (There are hundreds of programming languages). However, it captures something essential: \n",
        "\n",
        "* C represents **lower-level languages** that provide fine-grained control over computer resources and are often used for system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical tasks.\n",
        "* Java represents **object-oriented languages** that focus on reusable components and are often used for large-scale enterprise applications, web development, and platform-independent software.\n",
        "* Python represents **high-level**, easy-to-learn languages that provide a lot of abstraction, making them suitable for beginners, rapid prototyping, scripting, and various other tasks like web development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Success in computer science requires knowing which sort of language--and which level of \"abstraction\"--is right for whichever problem you happen to be tackling.\n"
