        "# Repeating Code: Introduction to Loops\n",
        "\n",
        "So far, our programs have executed code once through from top to bottom. However, many programming tasks require repeating the same actions multiple times. **Loops** allow you to execute code repeatedly without having to write it multiple times.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Are Loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Loops** are control structures that repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is met or for a specified number of iterations. They're like a chef making multiple pizzas using the same steps for each one.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Use Loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "Loops are essential because they allow your programs to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Reduce repetition**: Write code once and execute it multiple times\n",
        "* **Process collections of data**: Work with lists, strings, and other collections item by item\n",
        "* **Continue tasks until completion**: Repeat until a certain condition is met\n",
        "* **Create efficient solutions**: Solve problems that require iteration without writing redundant code\n",
        "\n",
        "## Types of Loops in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides two main types of loops:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`for` loops**: Used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat code\n",
        "   * Best for iterating through sequences (like strings or lists)\n",
        "   * Useful for counting or processing items one by one\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`while` loops**: Used when you want to repeat code until a condition changes\n",
        "   * Best for situations where you don't know how many iterations you need\n",
        "   * Continues until a specified condition becomes False\n",
        "\n",
        "## Loop Components\n",
        "\n",
        "All loops have common components:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Initialization**: Setting up before the loop starts\n",
        "* **Condition**: Determining whether to continue the loop\n",
        "* **Body**: The code that gets executed in each iteration\n",
        "* **Update**: Changing something that will eventually end the loop\n",
        "\n",
        "## Real-World Loop Examples\n",

        "| Task | Loop Type | Example |\n",

        "\n",
        "While for loops are great when you know exactly how many times you need to repeat code, **while loops** are perfect for situations where you need to continue until a certain condition is met. They're like cooking a pizza until it's done, regardless of how long it takes.\n",
