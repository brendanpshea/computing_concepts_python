        "\n",
        "A **relational database** is a type of database that organizes data into tables, with each table consisting of rows (also known as records or tuples) and columns (also known as fields or attributes). The tables are related to each other through **primary keys** and **foreign keys**, which establish relationships between the tables and allow for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a relational database, each table represents a specific entity or concept, and each row within a table represents a unique instance of that entity. The columns define the attributes or properties of the entity. The relationships between tables are established based on the **logical connections** between the entities they represent.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Relational databases** are based on the **relational model**, which was introduced by Edgar F. Codd in 1970. The relational model provides a mathematical foundation for organizing and manipulating data in a structured manner. It defines concepts such as **data integrity**, **normalization**, and **relational algebra**, which are essential for maintaining data consistency and performing complex queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's consider a relational database for a library system. The database might have tables such as \"Books,\" \"Authors,\" and \"Borrowers.\" The \"Books\" table could have columns like \"BookID\" (primary key), \"Title,\" \"AuthorID\" (foreign key referencing the \"Authors\" table), and \"PublicationYear.\" The \"Authors\" table could have columns like \"AuthorID\" (primary key) and \"AuthorName.\" The \"Borrowers\" table could have columns like \"BorrowerID\" (primary key), \"BorrowerName,\" and \"BookID\" (foreign key referencing the \"Books\" table).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the relationships between the tables are established through the foreign keys. The \"AuthorID\" in the \"Books\" table relates each book to its corresponding author in the \"Authors\" table, while the \"BookID\" in the \"Borrowers\" table relates each borrowed book to its corresponding book in the \"Books\" table. This allows for efficient querying and retrieval of data, such as finding all books written by a specific author or identifying the borrowers of a particular book."

        "\n",
        "**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a standard language used to interact with relational databases. It allows you to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data stored in the database tables. SQL provides various commands and clauses to perform different types of queries and operations on the database.\n",

        "-   **UPDATE**: Modifies existing records in a table.\n",
        "-   **DELETE**: Removes records from a table based on specified conditions.\n",
        "-   **JOIN**: Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.\n",
        "-   **WHERE**: Filters the result set based on specified conditions.\n",
        "-   **ORDER BY**: Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.\n",
        "-   **GROUP BY**: Groups the result set based on one or more columns.\n",
        "-   **HAVING**: Filters the grouped result set based on specified conditions.\n",
