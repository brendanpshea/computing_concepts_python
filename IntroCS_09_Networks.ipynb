From checking social media on your smartphone to streaming videos, playing online games, or even turning in homework assignments, nearly everything we do digitally involves networks in some way. Understanding how these networks function is crucial for anyone interested in computer science.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Networks allow devices to communicate and share resources through standardized rules known as **protocols** (sets of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices, similar to languages that computers use to communicate).\n",
        "* The internet is the largest and most well-known computer network, connecting billions of devices worldwide through various interconnected networks.\n",
        "* Modern applications rely on network communication to provide services like social media, online shopping, and video streaming.\n",

        "## What is a Computer Network?\n",
        "\n",
        "A computer network is a collection of interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources. These devices—which include computers, servers, smartphones, and even smart appliances—communicate through transmission media like cables or wireless signals, allowing them to send and receive information. Networks range from small home setups with just a few devices to massive enterprise networks and ultimately the global internet that connects billions of devices worldwide.\n",
        "\n",
        "* A **Local Area Network (LAN)** connects devices in a limited area like a home, school, or office building, typically owned and managed by a single organization.\n",
        "* A **Wide Area Network (WAN)** spans a large geographic area, often connecting multiple LANs across cities or countries—the internet itself is the largest example of a WAN.\n",
        "* Networks use specialized hardware devices like **routers** (devices that forward data packets between computer networks, determining the best path for data to travel) and **switches** (devices that connect multiple devices on a local network and use MAC addresses to direct traffic).\n",
        "* The **bandwidth** of a network refers to the maximum data transfer rate, measured in bits per second (bps), with modern networks often operating at millions (Mbps) or billions (Gbps) of bits per second.\n",
        "\n",
        "| Network Type | Geographic Scope | Example | Typical Speed |\n",
        "|--------------|------------------|---------|---------------|\n",
        "| LAN | Limited (building) | School computer lab | 100 Mbps - 10 Gbps |\n",

        "For example, your school's computer network is a LAN—all the computers in the lab, the printers, and the teacher's computers are connected through network cables to switches in a closet somewhere in the building. These switches connect to a router that connects your school's LAN to the internet (a WAN). When you print a document, the data travels across the LAN to the printer; when you visit a website, the data travels across both the LAN and WAN."

        "\n",
        "The TCP/IP model is a conceptual framework that standardizes how data is transmitted across networks. Named after its two most important protocols—Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP)—this model divides network communication into four distinct layers. Each layer builds upon the services provided by the layer below it, performing specific functions that contribute to successful data transmission. This layered approach makes network design more manageable by separating complex tasks into smaller components.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The TCP/IP model consists of four layers working together: Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Interface (sometimes called the Link layer).\n",
        "* Each layer has specific responsibilities and encapsulates data with additional information needed for that layer's functions—a process called **encapsulation** (whereby data is wrapped inside headers containing information needed for transmission).\n",
        "* As data moves down the layers on the sending device and up the layers on the receiving device, each layer adds or removes its own header information.\n",
        "* This layered approach allows for **interoperability** (the ability of different systems to work together seamlessly) by standardizing how communication occurs at each level.\n",
        "\n",
        "| Layer | Main Function | Key Protocols | Example |\n",
        "|-------|---------------|---------------|---------|\n",
        "| Application | User interfaces and applications | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS | Web browsers, email clients |\n",
        "| Transport | End-to-end connections and reliability | TCP, UDP | Port numbers, error checking |\n",
        "| Internet | Routing between networks | IP, ICMP | IP addressing, routing tables |\n",
        "| Network Interface | Physical connection to the network | Ethernet, Wi-Fi | Network cards, drivers |\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, when you type www.google.com in your browser, your request travels through all four layers:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Application Layer**: Your browser creates an HTTP request for Google's homepage\n",
        "2. **Transport Layer**: The request gets TCP headers added with port information (port 80 or 443)\n",
        "3. **Internet Layer**: IP headers are added with Google's server IP address as the destination\n",
        "4. **Network Interface Layer**: The data is converted into electrical signals that travel through your network cable or Wi-Fi\n",

It encompasses the protocols and interfaces that applications use to communicate over the network.

The Application Layer essentially serves as the interface between the software applications and the network.\n",

Your browser then uses HTTP or HTTPS to request the YouTube homepage from that IP address. When the data arrives, the Application Layer formats it properly so your browser can display the webpage. Similarly, when you check your email, your email client uses SMTP to send messages and either POP3 or IMAP to retrieve messages from the server—all happening at the Application Layer."

        "Data transmission across a network involves the systematic processing of information through each layer of the TCP/IP model, with each layer adding its own headers to prepare the data for the next stage of its journey. This process, known as encapsulation when moving down the layers and decapsulation when moving up, ensures that data is properly formatted, addressed, and transmitted reliably between devices. Understanding this flow of data provides insight into how network communication actually works.\n",

        "* The **Protocol Data Unit (PDU)** is the name given to data as it moves through the different layers—it's called data at the Application Layer, segments at the Transport Layer, packets at the Internet Layer, and frames at the Network Interface Layer.\n",

        "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web, defining how messages are formatted and transmitted between web browsers and servers. As an Application Layer protocol in the TCP/IP model, HTTP follows a request-response pattern where clients (usually web browsers) send requests for resources, and servers respond with the requested content or appropriate error messages. This standardized communication enables the seamless browsing experience we take for granted today.\n",
        "\n",
        "* HTTP operates as a **stateless protocol**, meaning each request-response pair is independent and the server doesn't maintain information about previous requests—this simplicity contributes to the scalability of web services.\n",
        "* An HTTP **request** from a client includes a request method (like GET or POST), a specific URL, headers containing additional information, and sometimes a body with data.\n",
        "* An HTTP **response** from a server includes a status code (like 200 for success or 404 for not found), headers with metadata, and often a body containing the requested resource (like an HTML page).\n",
        "* Common HTTP **methods** include GET (retrieve resources), POST (submit data), PUT (update resources), and DELETE (remove resources)—each defining different actions to be performed on the specified resource.\n",

In this model, servers are specialized computers or programs that provide specific services or resources, while clients are the devices or applications that request and use these services. This approach allows for efficient resource sharing, centralized management, and scalable network applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Clients** are typically user-facing applications (like web browsers, email clients, or mobile apps) that request data or services—they initiate communication, send requests, and process responses to present information to users.\n",
        "* **Servers** are specialized systems that provide services to multiple clients simultaneously—they listen for incoming requests, process them according to their programmed logic, and send appropriate responses.\n",
        "* The client-server model follows a **request-response cycle** where the client sends a formatted request to the server, the server processes the request and performs any necessary actions, and then the server returns a response to the client.\n",
        "* This architecture enables **resource sharing** (centralized data and services), **separation of concerns** (specialized roles for different components), and **scalability** (servers can be upgraded or multiplied to handle increased demand).\n",

        "For example, when you use Instagram on your phone, your phone app is the client and Instagram's computers are the servers. When you open the app, the client sends requests to Instagram's servers asking for your feed content. The servers process these requests by retrieving your friends' recent posts from their databases, then send this data back to your phone. The client app then displays the photos and videos on your screen. This same process happens whenever you post a photo (client sends photo data to server), like a post (client sends the \"like\" action to server), or follow someone (client sends a follow request to server)."

Created by Kenneth Reitz, this elegant and user-friendly library abstracts the complexities of making HTTP requests behind a simple API, allowing developers to send HTTP requests with minimal code. Requests is often described as \"HTTP for Humans\" because of its intuitive design, making it an excellent tool for beginners learning to interact with web services.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The Requests library handles all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), manages cookies, processes different encodings, and supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.\n",
        "* Before using Requests, you need to install it using pip, Python's package manager, with the command `pip install requests`.\n",
        "* The library's core functionality revolves around simple method calls that correspond to HTTP methods—such as `requests.get()` for GET requests and `requests.post()` for POST requests.\n",
        "* Response objects from Requests provide access to the status code, content, headers, and other important information returned by the server."

Understanding how to make and customize GET requests is an essential skill for any programmer working with web services.\n",

        "| TCP/IP Model | A conceptual framework that standardizes data transmission across networks through four layers: Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Interface. |\n",
        "| Application Layer | The highest layer in the TCP/IP model that encompasses protocols and interfaces applications use to communicate over networks, including HTTP, DNS, SMTP, and FTP. |\n",
        "| Transport Layer | The layer that manages end-to-end communication between applications, providing flow control, error checking, and data segmentation using protocols like TCP and UDP. |\n",
        "| Internet Layer | The layer responsible for handling the movement of packets between networks, using IP addresses for logical addressing and determining routing paths across interconnected networks. |\n",
        "| Network Interface Layer | The lowest layer in the TCP/IP model dealing with physical connections and basic communication protocols, handling MAC addresses and technologies like Ethernet and Wi-Fi. |\n",
        "| Encapsulation | The process where data is wrapped inside headers containing information needed for transmission as it moves down through the TCP/IP layers. |\n",
        "| Router | A device that forwards data packets between computer networks, determining the best path for data to travel from source to destination. |\n",
        "| IP Address | A logical numerical identifier assigned to devices on a network that enables routing across interconnected networks, with IPv4 using 32-bit addresses and IPv6 using 128-bit addresses. |\n",
        "| MAC Address | A unique 48-bit identifier assigned to network interfaces, used at the Network Interface Layer to identify devices on a local network. |\n",
        "| TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) | A Transport Layer protocol that provides reliable, connection-oriented communication by establishing connections, acknowledging received packets, and retransmitting lost packets. |\n",
        "| UDP (User Datagram Protocol) | A Transport Layer protocol offering connectionless communication without delivery guarantees, making it faster but less reliable than TCP, suitable for time-sensitive applications. |\n",
        "| Port Number | A 16-bit number ranging from 0 to 65535 that identifies specific applications or services on a device, with well-known ports (0-1023) reserved for common services. |\n",
        "| HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) | An Application Layer protocol that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between web browsers and servers, following a request-response pattern. |\n",
        "| DNS (Domain Name System) | A protocol that translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses needed for routing. |\n",
        "| Client-Server Model | An architectural pattern where computing tasks are distributed between service providers (servers) and service requesters (clients). |\n",
        "| API (Application Programming Interface) | A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other, enabling access to functionality or data from external systems. |\n",
        "| JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) | A lightweight data format used for data exchange between web services and applications, consisting of key-value pairs similar to Python dictionaries. |\n",
        "| Requests Library | A Python HTTP client library that simplifies making HTTP requests by abstracting the complexities behind a simple API. |\n",
        "| HTTP Status Code | A numeric code included in an HTTP response that indicates the result of the request, with different ranges for success (200s), redirection (300s), client errors (400s), and server errors (500s). |\n",
        "| HTTP Method | Commands like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE that define different actions to be performed on specified resources in HTTP requests. |\n",
        "| Bandwidth | The maximum data transfer rate of a network, measured in bits per second (bps), with modern networks operating at millions (Mbps) or billions (Gbps) of bits per second. |"
