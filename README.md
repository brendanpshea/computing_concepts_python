Welcome to **Computing Concepts with Python**, an open-access textbook designed to introduce students to the foundational concepts of computer science. The textbook includes Jupyter notebooks with interactive exercises, real-world examples, and practical coding exercises using Python.

## Interactive Learning Tools

### PyQuiz
PyQuiz is an interactive Python coding practice tool designed to help students learn and practice Python programming through a series of coding questions. It provides a user-friendly interface using IPython widgets, making it ideal for use in Jupyter notebooks or similar interactive Python environments.

### Loop of the Recursive Dragon
Loop of the Recursive Dragon is an interactive quiz game that combines elements of role-playing games with educational quizzes. Students can battle monsters by answering questions correctly, earning gold, and upgrading their equipment as they progress through the game.

## A Note on the Use of AI Tools
These chapters were initially developed as the "generative AI" explosion took off (starting with OpenAI's GPT 3.0). The author has experimented with many of these tools—including successive versions of ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, CoPilot, Mistral, and others—in helping to turn lecture notes into a proper book. While these tools can be helpful, they are not a replacement for the expertise and effort required to produce quality, meaningful educational content.
