## A Note on the Use of AI Tools
These chapters were initially developed as the "generative AI" explosion took off (starting with OpenAI's GPT 3.0). The author has experimented with many of these tools—including successive versions of ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, CoPilot, Mistral, and others—in helping to turn lecture notes into a proper book. While these tools can be helpful, they are not a replacement for the expertise and effort required to produce quality, meaningful educational content.
