[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/computing_concepts_python/blob/main/IntroCS_02_FileFormats_PacMan.ipynb)  
This chapter uses the classic game **Pac-Man** to explore different **file formats** and how they store data. You will learn about text-based formats like CSV and JSON, as well as binary formats used in games and multimedia.

### 3. Networks
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/computing_concepts_python/blob/main/IntroCS_03_Networks.ipynb)  
This chapter introduces the basics of computer networks, including how computers communicate over the internet, IP addresses, and the structure of the web. You'll also explore the protocols that power network communication.

### 4. Introduction to Python Strings
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/computing_concepts_python/blob/main/IntroCS_04_Python_Strings.ipynb)  
Learn the fundamentals of **Python programming**, starting with string manipulation. You will practice creating, modifying, and analyzing strings using Python, and apply these skills to simple text-based tasks.

### 5. Integers, Floats, and Functions
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/computing_concepts_python/blob/main/IntroCS_05_IntsFloatsFunctions.ipynb)  
This chapter focuses on numerical data types in Python—**integers** and **floats**. You'll also learn about **functions**, how to define them, and how to use them to organize and reuse your code.

### 6. Conditionals and Logic
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/computing_concepts_python/blob/main/IntroCS_06_Conditionals.ipynb)  
An introduction to **conditional statements** and logical operators in Python. This chapter teaches you how to write code that can make decisions based on conditions, including working with `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements.

### 7. Algorithms and Loops
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/computing_concepts_python/blob/main/IntroCS_07_Algorithms_and_Loops.ipynb)  
Learn about **algorithms** and how to implement them using **loops** in Python. This chapter covers `for` and `while` loops, helping you to automate repetitive tasks and develop efficient algorithms for problem-solving.

### 8. Cybersecurity
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/computing_concepts_python/blob/main/IntroCS_08_CyberSecurity.ipynb)  
An introduction to **cybersecurity** concepts, including encryption, data privacy, and security vulnerabilities. You'll explore real-world examples of security breaches and learn how to protect data in the digital world.

### 9. Data and Databases
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/computing_concepts_python/blob/main/IntroCS_09_Data_and_Databases.ipynb)  
This chapter introduces you to the world of **data** and **databases**. You will learn how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated using databases like **SQLite**, and practice writing simple queries to retrieve data.

### 10. Dictionaries, Objects, and Tests
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/computing_concepts_python/blob/main/IntroCS_10_DictionariesObjectsTests.ipynb)  
Learn about Python **dictionaries** and how to work with **objects** in Python. This chapter also introduces the concept of **unit testing** and how to ensure your code is functioning as expected.

### 11. The Birth of AI
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/computing_concepts_python/blob/main/IntroCS_11_BirthOfAI.ipynb)  
Explore the history and development of **artificial intelligence**. This chapter provides a broad overview of AI's origins, key milestones, and current trends in machine learning and intelligent systems.

### 12. Neural Networks
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/computing_concepts_python/blob/main/IntroCS_12_NeuralNets.ipynb)  
An introduction to **neural networks** and how they power modern AI. You'll learn about the structure and function of neural networks, and apply these concepts to build a simple neural network using Python libraries.

**A Note on the Use of AI Tools.** These chapters were intitially developed as the “generative AI” explosion took off (staring with OpenAI’s GPT 3.0), and I’ve had fun experimenting with many of these tools—including successive versions of ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, CoPilot, Mistral, and others—in helping to turn my (voluminous, but often unorganized) lecture notes into something resembling a proper book. My experience was these tools with these has been generally positive, and I think that they can someday do at least some of the work done by traditional editors and publishing houses (I say this as a former editor at an academic press!). I’m less convinced they are going to immediately replace the actual *writer* or *programmer*, though, as there’s still a fair amount of expertise (and effort!) into producing quality, meaningful output.
