## Chapter 0: Computers and Hardware

In this chapter, you'll embark on a journey to understand the fundamental concepts of computers and hardware. You'll start by learning what a computer is and exploring the field of Computer Science. You'll then delve into the Binary number system, the language of zeros and ones that computers understand, and the role of transistors, the tiny switches that are the building blocks of all digital devices.

You'll also learn how to convert numbers between binary and decimal formats, and get introduced to the octal and hexadecimal number systems. You'll discover the Central Processing Unit (CPU)—the brain of a computer—and its key components: the Control Unit and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

This chapter will guide you through the different types of memory, including RAM and ROM, and discuss the differences between volatile and non-volatile memory. You'll learn about the storage devices that computers use, such as Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs), and understand the role of the motherboard, the main circuit board that connects all computer components.

Finally, you'll get introduced to the operating system concept, focusing on the open-source Linux system and its popular distribution, Ubuntu. You'll also cover the concepts of input and output, and understand how computers handle data transfer through methods like interrupts and polling.

Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial to your journey in computer science. This chapter lays the groundwork for everything else you'll learn in this course and beyond. 

## Chapter 1: Files and Formats

In this chapter, you'll delve into the world of computer files and formats. You'll learn what a computer file is, how it's stored, and how its data layout is determined by its file format. You'll also understand the role of file extensions in indicating the type of data stored in a file.

You'll explore different character encoding standards, such as ASCII and Unicode, and understand their role in digital data representation. You'll also be introduced to Markup Languages and learn how to use Markdown to format text. You'll also learn about XML, a text-based data format with strong support for different human languages.

This chapter will guide you through the concept of source code, the fundamental component of a computer program. You'll get to know about different programming languages like Python and C, and learn about Jupyter notebooks, a popular tool for combining code and rich text elements in a single document.

You'll understand the difference between interpreted and compiled languages, and learn about executable files, assembly language, and machine code. You'll also explore different file formats like CSV for tabular data, and understand what a database is.

You'll learn about the RGB color model and the process of compression to save storage space or data transmission time. You'll explore different file formats for storing images and audio, such as BMP, JPEG, WAV, and MP3.

Finally, you'll get hands-on experience with Ubuntu commands for changing directories, listing files, and creating new files. You'll also understand the difference between lossy and lossless compression.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a solid understanding of how data is stored and represented in computers. This knowledge is crucial for anyone looking to work with digital data, whether it's creating software applications, managing databases, or processing digital media.
