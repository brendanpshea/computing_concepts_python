# Computing Concepts With Python
### Brendan Shea, PhD | Brendan.Shea@rctc.edu
Welcome to *Computing Concepts With Python.* This free, interactive textbook is designed to introduce the fundamental concepts of computer science through interactive learning. As a beginning student in this field, you are embarking on a journey to understand not only the theoretical underpinnings of computer systems and programming but also their practical applications. This textbook is unique as it is freely accessible, editable, and shareable under its OER license, supporting a collaborative and adaptive learning environment. I'd love to hear your feedback on what worked and what doesn't!

The chapters are deliveed in Jupyter notebooks, which means you'll be able to write and run code as you read. By default, you can do this with Google's (free) Colab computing platform. If you've never used Google Colab before, I think you'll find it's pretty intutive. I've put together a tutorial here: [Ch 0: Brendan's Colab Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/computing_concepts_python/blob/main/IntroCS_00_Intro_to_Colab.ipynb).

**A Note on the Use of AI Tools.** These chapters were intitially developed as the “generative AI” explosion took off (staring with OpenAI’s GPT 3.0), and I’ve had fun experimenting with many of these tools—including successive versions of ChatGPT, Google Bard, Claude, Codey, CoPilot, Mistral, and others—in helping to turn my (voluminous, but often unorganized) lecture notes into something resembling a proper book. My experience was these tools with these has been generally positive, and I think that they can someday do at least some of the work done by traditional editors and publishing houses (I say this as a former editor at an academic press!). I’m less convinced they are going to immediately replace the actual *writer* or *programmer*, though, as there’s still a fair amount of expertise (and effort!) into producing quality, meaningful output.
