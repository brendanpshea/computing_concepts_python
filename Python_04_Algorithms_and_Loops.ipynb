        "An *algorithm* is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules for solving a particular problem or accomplishing a specific task. Algorithms can be found in various aspects of everyday life and computing. They are the basis for how computer programs and applications function, as well as how people make decisions or solve problems in their daily lives.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of algorithms in computing:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Sorting algorithms: Sorting is a common computational task where items are arranged in a specific order, such as alphabetical, numerical, or chronological. Some popular sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. These algorithms have different ways of organizing data, but they all achieve the same goal of sorting items.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Search algorithms: Search algorithms are used to locate specific items or data within a larger data set. Examples include Linear Search, which involves iterating through each item in the data set until the desired item is found, and Binary Search, which involves repeatedly dividing a sorted data set in half and checking if the desired item is in the left or right subset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of algorithms in everyday life:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Cooking a recipe: When you cook a meal following a recipe, you are essentially executing an algorithm. The recipe provides a list of ingredients and a step-by-step procedure to follow in order to prepare the dish. By following the steps in the correct order, you will successfully cook the meal.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Driving to a destination: When you drive from one location to another, you follow a series of steps and make decisions based on traffic conditions, road signs, and your knowledge of the route. This process can be considered an algorithm, as you are following a procedure to reach your destination.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Getting dressed: The process of getting dressed involves a sequence of actions, such as selecting clothes, putting them on in a specific order, and adjusting as needed. This routine can be seen as an algorithm for preparing yourself for the day.\n",
        "\n",
        "So: an algorithm is a systematic set of rules or instructions used to solve problems or accomplish tasks. They can be found in both computing and everyday life, guiding actions and decisions to achieve specific goals."

        "# Properties of Algorithms\n",
        "The technical definition of an algorithm is *a finite, well-defined sequence of steps or instructions that, when followed, accomplishes a specific task or solves a particular problem.* An algorithm must have the following properties:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Unambiguity: Each step of the algorithm should be clearly defined and not open to multiple interpretations. The instructions must be precise and unambiguous to ensure consistent execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Finiteness: An algorithm must have a finite number of steps. It should eventually terminate after a limited number of iterations or actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Input: An algorithm typically takes zero or more input values to process and generate the desired output. These inputs can be in various forms, such as numbers, text, or other data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Output: An algorithm must produce at least one output, which is the result of processing the input data. The output is the solution to the problem or the accomplishment of the task.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  Effectiveness: The steps in an algorithm should be simple, basic, and executable within a finite amount of time. The algorithm should be efficient and practical for the problem it is designed to solve.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of things that are algorithms:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Binary search algorithm: A binary search algorithm is used to find a specific value in a sorted array. It repeatedly divides the array in half, comparing the middle element with the target value, and then narrowing the search to the left or right half, depending on the comparison result. This algorithm is unambiguous, finite, takes input, generates output, and is effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Euclidean algorithm: The Euclidean algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It repeatedly applies the division algorithm, replacing the larger integer with the remainder of the division until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD. This algorithm satisfies all the properties of an algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of things that are not algorithms:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  A vague recipe: A recipe that lacks specific measurements or cooking times, or has ambiguous instructions, does not qualify as an algorithm. It fails the unambiguity and effectiveness criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  An infinite loop: A sequence of steps that never terminates (e.g., \"repeat the action forever\") is not an algorithm, as it does not meet the finiteness requirement.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  A philosophical argument: A philosophical argument or debate may involve logical reasoning but does not constitute an algorithm, as it lacks specific input and output, and may not be unambiguous or effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "The nature of algorithms can help us appreciate why computers are so good at certain tasks, and so bad at others."

        "Computers excel at tasks that involve repetitive calculations, processing large volumes of data, or following explicit instructions with precision and speed. Their ability to perform loops and execute repetitive tasks quickly and accurately is a significant advantage over humans. Some tasks that computers do well, better or faster than humans, include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Mathematical calculations: Computers can perform complex mathematical operations and calculations much faster and more accurately than humans. They can handle large numbers, fractions, and various arithmetic or algebraic operations with ease.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Data processing and analysis: Computers can process and analyze vast amounts of data efficiently. Tasks such as sorting, searching, filtering, and statistical analysis can be performed rapidly by computers, often outpacing human capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Repetitive tasks: Computers excel at performing repetitive tasks through loops, which allow them to execute the same set of instructions multiple times without errors or fatigue. Examples include running simulations, generating reports, or updating databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Pattern recognition: Computers can be trained to recognize patterns in data using machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. They can process large datasets to identify trends, anomalies, or correlations that might be challenging for humans to detect.\n",

        "1.  Natural language understanding: While computers have made significant progress in natural language processing, they still struggle with understanding context, idiomatic expressions, and implicit meanings in human language.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Emotional intelligence: Computers lack the ability to perceive, understand, and respond to human emotions effectively. They struggle to interpret subtle cues, such as tone of voice, body language, or facial expressions, that humans use to communicate emotions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Creativity: Computers can produce original content based on algorithms or templates, but they generally lack the human-like creativity that drives innovation, artistic expression, or problem-solving in novel situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Common sense reasoning: Computers struggle with tasks that require common sense or general knowledge about the world. They often lack the ability to make inferences based on everyday experiences or situations, which humans can do with ease."

Bubble sort is a simple and intuitive algorithm, but it can be slow and inefficient for large data sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insertion Sort: \n",
        "This algorithm works by iterating through an array and inserting each element into its proper position in a sorted sub-array. The sorted sub-array starts with just the first element of the original array and grows one element at a time until the entire array is sorted. Insertion sort is also a simple and intuitive algorithm, but it can also be slow for large data sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Merge Sort: \n",
        "This algorithm works by dividing an array into two halves, recursively sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves back together. The merging process involves comparing the first element of each half and adding the smaller one to a new array. The process continues until all elements have been merged back into a single sorted array. Merge sort is more efficient than bubble and insertion sort for larger data sets, but it requires more memory to store the extra arrays used in the merging process.\n",

        "### Quick Sort: \n",
        "This algorithm works by selecting a \"pivot\" element from an array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively using the same process. The main advantage of quicksort is that it is very efficient for large data sets and can be implemented in a way that requires little extra memory. However, it can be less predictable than merge sort in terms of performance and can be slower for data sets with many duplicates or already mostly sorted data.\n",

Big O notation allows us to abstract away the specific details of an algorithm and focus on its overall efficiency as the input size grows.\n",

We typically ignore lower-order terms and constant factors, since these become less significant as n grows large. For example, the Big O notation for bubble sort is O(n^2), which means that the worst-case running time of bubble sort grows quadratically with the input size. This is because bubble sort requires iterating over the entire array multiple times, which leads to a nested loop structure.\n",

        "## Exercise 2: camelCase and snake_case\n",
        "In some languages, it’s common to use camel case (otherwise known as “mixed case”) for variables’ names when those names comprise multiple words, whereby the first letter of the first word is lowercase but the first letter of each subsequent word is uppercase. For instance, whereas a variable for a user’s name might be called name, a variable for a user’s first name might be called firstName, and a variable for a user’s preferred first name (e.g., nickname) might be called preferredFirstName.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python, by contrast, recommends snake case, whereby words are instead separated by underscores (_), with all letters in lowercase. For instance, those same variables would be called name, first_name, and preferred_first_name, respectively, in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a function called `camel_to_snake_case()`, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case. Assume that the user’s input will indeed be in camel case.\n",

        "1. Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.\n",
        "2. Much like a list, a str is “iterable,” which means you can iterate over each of its characters in a loop. For instance, if s is a str, you could print each of its characters, one at a time, with code like:\n",
        "```\n",
        "for c in s:\n",
